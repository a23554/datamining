10,"I came in with meager expectations and was genuinely blown away with how the film handled the story, paced the action, and played out as a whole. The acting was superb, the effects made you feel like you were watching a Star Wars film - and not some CGI mind-maze - and the story was genuinely well written. I loved all of the classic Star Wars easter eggs that were thrown in, and that the main character gave a nod to Jan Ors from the Dark Forces games of the 90s. It was original, but above all very entertaining. The critic metascore does not reflect its quality. It definitely plays out more like a war drama in a sci-fi setting than anything else, but I think it is all the better for it. Although quite different from any of its predecessors, it is a wonderful film that I feel surpasses The 'Force Awakens' in almost every facet, and can rightly take its spot with Episodes IV-VI in the Star Wars canon."
10,"Critics are pretty wrong on this one. Characters could have been developed a little more, but the tension, cinematography and, overall story didn't disappoint. No one in my theater seemed unhappy and many even clapped an cheered and this was 2 days after the premier on a 6:30 showing."
10,"I was 12 when the last decent Star Wars movie came out.I've been burned ever since: Special Editions, Prequels, Force Awakens (sorry, it sucks).So the bar was pretty low going in to the midnight screening.10 minutes in and I remember turning to my friend (another 70's child) and saying 'I don't know about you, but I'm f**kin lovin this already'.By the end I couldn't get out of the seat. I was an emotional wreck. I had another emotional breakdown in the car on the way home.To everyone involved in making this film:Thank you for making Star Was awesome againI'm going again tonight, just to make sure I didn't dream this."

Rogue One was spectacular and everything I wanted it to be. I consider this movie an apology for the abysmal Force Awakens and for this I can only say one thing: Apology accepted!
"
10,"10/10    I AM ONE WITH THE FORCE, AND THE FORCE IS WITH ME! I'm absolutely stunned and thrilled right now because I just witnessed the most authentic and truest representation of a Star Wars film since the original classic trilogy. This was nothing short of phenomenal and executed every single aspect of the galaxy/franchise in flawless fashion. From the gargantuan scale of the vastly magnificently planet scapes and ships to the wild variation of the characters, this might be the greatest film in the franchise yet. The action scenes are plenty and are amazingly set up on the ground and in the air. The cgi is the best I've seen in any film ever and the grand scale is masterful. The story was easily the most adventurous and well told than any in the franchise. The score was brilliant and captured the Star Wars feel beautifully. Gareth Edwards will now be known as one of the best new directors around after crafting this masterpiece. I was going to wait to see but couldn't hold my excitement and I would recommend everyone see this in the theatre for all It's glory."

Love this movie so much.  Great story, great acting, great pacing, great plot.  The ending was epic.  Going to see it again tomorrow. The movie starts of slow but builds to a hectic tempo by the end.
"
10,"While Force Awakens played heavily on the nostalgia factor, Rogue One takes all the risks and it works out wonderful. No opening scroll so we jump right into the action. It ties up a lot of plot holes from the previous films (such as why the Death Star had it's fatal flaw), The action scenes are beautiful and the ending couldn't have been any better. They took a lot of risks with the CG (anyone who saw the film knows what I am talking about) but it paid off perfectly.My only complaint is that they didn't use the new villain as well as they could have. Aside from that, Go and see it immediately. It blows FA out of the water imo and I loved FA."

This is a movie about war.  A war that takes place amongst the stars.  It has a lot of war in it, and also a lot of stars.  I guess what I'm saying is that if you wanted a movie about war, and stars, you came to the right place.  10/10

Great.great.great! Everything I wanted, yet so much more. Some of the best war scenes in any fantasy film, let alone star wars! Edwards is one to look out for.

10,"This is the Star Wars you've been waiting for.  This is the Star Wars we deserve.  The best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy.  Its got everything you could ever want, from storm troopers and gritty combat, to space battles and a more traditional take on faith in The Force.  I want to go into detail, but I dont want to ruin the experience for anyone.  Just know its a great Star Wars film, and perfectly ties into the original trilogy.Hollywood:  this is it,  this is what we want.  All future movies need to take their cue from Rogue One.  I dont know why the critics rated this lower than Force Awakens, clearly the fans are rating this higher, and I'm right there with them.Great, great movie.  Go watch it!"

This is my second favorite movie of the entire year so far, behind only Captain America: Civil War. This movie was action packed, had great performances, and tied in perfectly to the Star Wars universe. It's everything we've been hoping for and more.
"
10,"This movie is simply amazing. Walking out of the theater I wasn't thinking about how great it was but rather, 'I have to watch this again NOW'. If you were not around when episode 4 hit the screens then it would be hard to imagine how it changed our culture. People didn't ask you if you have seen Star Wars. They asked you how many times you have seen Star Wars. A feat that movie makers have not been able to accomplish since. This move IS episode 3, despite it's billing. Was it perfect? No. Good luck finding that on a screen today. If you are a fan of Scifi you will not be disappointed. If you are old you will feel again what you felt upon watching the original."
10,"Cuesta escribir una critica objetiva siendo fan de la saga SW, pero cumple con todas las expectativas y las supera. La pelcula, llena de guios a episodio IV transforma a la doctrina jedi y 'la fuerza' en portadora de fe."
10,"First of all all the haters out there need to stfu.  How pathetic and unintelligent does a human have to be to rate this epic movie low?  We are talking about the most loved franchise of all time and what these filmmakers have managed to do is nothing short of extraordinary.  Go see this movie in 3d now !!!  All I have to say is bacta tank !"

10,"Phenomenal. The Star Wars film I've been waiting for since 1983. Dark and foreboding, excellent characterization,and the hour-long battle in the second half of the film is the best in the franchise yet. A worthy achievement and highly recommended for all old Star Wars fans like me."
10,"This movie is for true Star Wars fans. It is the best movie since Empire. Perfectly ties in between Episode 3 and Episode 4. They even brought back Peter Cushing from the grave (albeit freaky and cool at the same time). There is no love story, no stupid characters like Jar Jar, no annoying little kid who loves Pod Racing, no anorexic chick named Rey who can wield the Force within three minutes, no whiny Kylo Ren with daddy issues, it is a perfect Star Wars movie. It is purely Empire vs Alliance in a Dirty Dozen type atmosphere. Go see it!"
10,"They left the best movie of the year for last wow!.Incredible cast and relateable characters and atmosphere was definitely a step up and proves what Disney can do,haven't seen it? go see it NOW!,seen it? go see it again to relive what an impressive,outstanding movie this is.Legendary"

Dont expect anything like the originals, but this was a damn good movie for what it is. The second part of the movie is beyond amazing and the main character she is a fun one. Her companion is boring though.
"
10,"-- Spoiler Free --Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since original trilogy. Period.Significant to say it adds weight to original trilogy and that is a worthy achievement itself. Lore of original trilogy was left intact and overall it is a must see film.Also it is a completely unusual film for Star Wars franchise and some people will dislike this film for that since it has no light saber duels and it's more focused on the heart of rebellion and it's people."
10,"First I have to state: I disliked, even despised 'A Force Awakens', a movie without a single original thought, badly executed. Rogue One is no less than the best Star Wars Movie ever made. The characters are great, the pacing is just right. With Protagonists that matter to you, you want to spend some time with, before you descend into the slaughterhouse together.All those who criticise the slow start of the film I have to tell: Just wait for the next Star Wars Movie (VIII). You'll get your soul/mindless J.J.Abrams opus soon enough!"

10,"Star Wars Rogue One was personally one of my favorite Star Wars movies. The movie takes a while to get the viewer's attention, but after that the movie became very interessting. CGI was well done, casting and acting was good and storyline was well written and unpredictable. (SPOILER ALERT): This is also one of the few action movies and the only Star Wars movie were they main characters die."

My favorite star wars movie to date.  I absolutely loved the new characters. The monk character being my favorite by far. I honestly couldn't think of any negatives really.
"
10,"'In the grim darkness of the galaxy far, far away, there is only war.'This movie is so much different than anything you have ever seen from Star Wars. It's like guys at Disney got inspired by Game of Thrones attitude to plot armor and decided to do something similar in their movie. And the fact that their movie is 7+ didn't stop them at all.Seriously, this movie plays with your mind by making you think it will be yet another rehash from previous parts. Once again we get an orphan, who gets adopted, who apparently is rich in force and whose relatives are kidnapped by the empire. At the begginning we get loads of miracles, stormtroopers are as inaccurate as always and we are made into thinking it will be like that for the whole movie. Except it's not - at some point the plot armor for characters starts to get worn out and falls from them, leaving them fragile and unprotected. First insignificant characters start to die. Then gradually more significant ones. Eventually we aren't even sure about the fate of main protagonists, but we are still getting hints that they might survive. And then it turns out they don't. That's when the whole tragicness of this situation hits us. They are not superheroes, not another reincarnation of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, that will get miraciously rescued from almost every situation. They are just desperate guys with nothing to lose, doing their suicide mission. Flashbacks of them saying various stuff, that might spoil the final ending hits you like a goddamn train and you get really, really depressed. If you took away the details from this movie, you would think it's the description of some Warhammer 40k novel, because how grimdark it is. But like WH40k, it's much more than that. It's a beautiful tale about hope, fighting against all odds, sacrifice and heroism. For me it's probably the best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back and who knows if not the best Star Wars movie ever."
10,"It was the best in the franchise right behind Empire Strikes Back. The cast was amazing. The story was amazing. The cameos were awesome. This movie is so damn good on so many levels. The only complaints I have are the slow opening and the movies score. Music could have been better. Nothing more to complain about after that."
10,"
Good movie; thoroughly enjoyed it!  It is worth seeing it in a movie theater.  Favorite character is the robot; it's dialogue responses just added to make it a fun action movie.
"
10,"Just got home from the movie.  Extremely good movie, BUT be aware that this is more like a war movie with the Star Wars brand.  I took my 6 year old and he was very bored (he was fine during 'Force Awakens').  Noting those facts, this is perhaps one of the better movies from the Star Wars brand... great acting, sets, effects and tie in to the franchise.  Perhaps think of it as Star Wars Episode 3.5!  Good Work!"
10,"What a fantastic Star Wars film. Star Wars for adults who grew up wanting to do battle in a galaxy far, far away. The characters here are some of the most interesting you'll find in Star Wars, and the villains are darkly glorious. Fathers, hug your daughters; we're in for a ride."
10,"Really just reviewing this a 10 to balance the critic reviews. As a casual Star Wars fan I want to say 3 quick things about this movie:1. It is a very 'efficiently' produced film. No scene seems unnecessary.2. It is accessible for non-Star Wars die-hards like me, and today I'm actually gonna watch 4, 5, and 6 because it has piqued my interest in the series.3. Based on talking about this with friends, it feels like what 'Reach' was to the Halo series. As Vox has put it, while a Disney movie, this is a movie about war.I really liked this movie. It was better than the last movie I saw in theatres, Arrival, and I really liked that movie too. This movie isn't as deep and provocative, but it's better.If you are an experienced consumer of culture stuffs like games, music, movies, and TV shows I would say that a good lens to try to see this movie from is you as a kid, watching a serious war movie. As I get older I tend to compare everything to the best entries in the entire gamut of the culture genre, but if we are just going to compare every game to The Last of Us and every show to Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, everything is going to suck comparatively.Rogue One is definitely worth your $15 to watch in 3D. Go with someone younger than you, I went with my niece, and she really liked it."

This is a good Star Wars. A refreshing look at the franchise. It patch a lot of the faults in the old trilogy. I like the more mature look at the characters as well.
"
10,"
I really enjoyed the movie.However, the movie doesn't contribute to the canon in any meaningful way.150 characters long dong sing-a-long song. Yeap
"
10,"In my opinion this is one of the best star wars movies ever. It's gritty, grounded, has a lot of action and callbacks to the original trilogy, and overall great. Most of the characters also have great development and i am actually sympathetic for the villain. Vader in this movie is so satisfying and all the scenes that he's in is amazing, it really shows what Vader really is. The only negative that i have with this movie is probably the characters with the CGI face which doesn't work as seamlessly as it could be."
10,"The force is strong with Rogue One. After a clunky but enjoyable first act, the movie finds its true setting and continues to grow on itself. The film is written fantastically with no cheesy or cringe worthy moments which allows the more mature audiences to enjoy the pacing and tone of the film. Gareth Edwards took a risk with this film by adding certain elements into it and it pays off beautifully and sets up the NOW perfect film 'A NEW HOPE'."
10,"Being a Star Wars fan-girl is a plus! You will enjoy this movie til the end! Some of the characters in Rogue One die off in very random paced areas in the film, but i still thoroughly loved the film! Gareth Edwards really did it for me... I was skeptical about him, because of Monsters. Now that i've seen this movie twice, and it still amazes me! Loved Donnie Yen's character Chirrut, his take on the Force has really refreshing... the chant/mantra he says will stick with me forever! 'I am with the Force, and the Force with me.' Fantsatic Classic to put in Best of films books of 2016!"
10,"I loved this film! I am a huge Star Wars fan and was not as satisfied as most with The Force Awakens (I won't even discuss the prequels). To me it was just missing something that this film has in abundance, heart! The characters really sell this story and they are perhaps one of the most interesting motley crews in Star Wars history. It was so fascinating to see how everything fit together just prior to A New Hope and this film actually answers several questions fans have had for nearly 40 years. It really does fit in nicely with the Star Wars mythos and it's exciting to watch! Some have criticized it for being too dark. Well keep in mind that this time period was the peak of the Empire's dominance. The Rebel Alliance had to make a huge stand to start any kind of challenge against it's tyrannical grip over the universe. Thus war was inevitable. This movie does an amazing job of conveying the dark period in which everything was set and it does an even better job of showing how even the smallest sacrifices during such a period can cause huge effects. People die. That is part of war. What really shocked me about Rogue One is that there really is no Force, no Skywalkers, no Jedi, and yet it feels more true to the original films than the last 4 have. It breaks every rule of a Star Wars film and yet managed to do everything right in the process. There are so many pleasant surprises in watching this that every fan should be smiling ear to ear by the time it's over. Yes there are sad moments, but this isn't supposed to be the feel-good movie of the holidays. It's supposed to fill in a spot that existed prior to the very first time Star Wars was introduced to us. Not only is it successful in this regard, but it introduces characters that will long go down in the history books of how the Empire crumbled. Don't miss it!"
10,"As a star wars fan, not a single movie in recent history has made me as excited and amazed as rouge one has. This movie has some over extended moments that get a bit pale, and some acts may be slightly weak; but the rest makes up for it 100%. The action, cinematography, feel of wonder is all there and better than ever. I don't think Darth Vader has ever been more Vader and I don't we have ever seen a ground battle to this scale. This isn't your regular star wars movie but definitely not in a bad way."
10,"I was 7 when I watched my first Star Wars movie 'A New Hope' it was the year 1987. I guess I can say that I prefer old movies above all else, maybe because of that I hated every frame of it. Before I was going to ROGIU ONE I honestly had no expectations, NO HOPE at all.My GOD. I was gonna cry in the end. That was the movie I was waiting for since 'Empire Strikes Back'. Visually the movie is a masterpiece, way and way better then 'Episode VII'. Battles are breath taking, I dont wanna spoil it that is why I cant go into detail. THIS MOVIE DESCRIBES THE 'WAR' in STAR WARS. A real war, where everyone SUFFERS, where darkness looms, innocent & evil die, this story shows what we have never seen before.And such an ending, thanks to Gareth Edwards, really I can die in peace now, this movie is the one and one only that almost made me cry, smile, laugh, made me sit on the edge of my seat on the second part.I GUARANTEE YOU, if you love EPISODE 4-5-6 the most, THIS IS THE MOVIE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR."

10,"This is a guy's Star Wars movie that stars a chick in the lead. Trust me--if you owned all the toys when you were 11 years old, you are going to go bonkers over this thing. It's The Dirty Dozen in space with Darth Vader and AT ATs. During the last third of this thing I felt like I could take on the whole Empire myself. It's a flawed masterpiece. Weakest part is the music and some pacing problems in the first act--but it's not weak enough to affect my score."
10,"After the disappointment from the Force Awakens I went to the cinema with very low expectations for Rogue One. However, the movie far surpassed them. I expected cheesy moments, hollow motivational speeches, badly adapted setting. It was none of these. Apart from an unconvincing martial arts character, everything in Rogue One was Star Wars from the beginning to the end. Great humor, memorable cameos and references, intensive action scenes and all of this - without overdoing it. Awesome work!"
10,"From the visual direction taken from the original trilogy, to the dirty environments, darker tone, interesting and varied cast of characters, and phenomenal ending, this just turned out to be my favoutite Star Wars movie since The Return of the Jedi! While far from bad, only the soundtrack didn't 100% met my expectations.Surprisingly good movie and even better Star Wars one. 9.5/10"

There is not much to say about this film other than the fact that it has exceeded all my expectations and its mediocre score. Seriously, what more could a Star Wars fan want? I can't thank the people involved in this film enough.
"
10,"What happens when you take Xwing alliance , Darkforces and the new canon? Rogue one ! Rogue one is an amazing movie.But beyond that its an amazing StarWars movie.However I do feel that those who hated TFA for its ''fan service'' will hate rogue one even more.Those who hated TFA for it being a base outline to ANH might end up liking Rogue one a lot. As for me I love TFA , I think its amazing. But I cant compare it to rogue one much as they are different. Rogue one is a movie set in the StarWars universe , not a classic StarWars movie.You see TFA had small doses of ''fan service'' but it had a lot of the old cast that was seen by some as ''fan service'' when it was just by narative purpose. the fan service in TFA came from background objects and mentions and it was awesome.Rogue one has even more , and guess what... that makes it a better movie. its a movie for the fans , and it should be. afterall only the first one should be open to a new public the rest should be for fans only.This movie features fans wet-dreams such as : -Live action kyber crystals ! -VADER ! -Hammerhead cruisers !!!!!!!!-C1-10P and the ghost from rebels ! -old planets -details of lore that need to be seen on the big screen.The movie assumes you love StarWars and read the canon books and comics and watch the shows , and that makes it perfect.The story is great , the action is somewhat brutal (for a StarWars movie) and the charecters are moraly grey."
10,"I didn't care for the director's 'Godzilla' movie (too much serious dialogue from characters I didn't care about), so I wondered how likeable this would be. I didn't like Rogue One ... I LOVED it (and the characters)! While it started on the slower end of things, by the time the movie ended and the credits rolled, my mind was blown. I knew it took place somewhere between SW3 and SW4, but what they did, how they handled it - hard to describe. Something like this: you go to the zoo to see a Lion, but before you leave, you've got your head in it's mouth looking down it's throat - unexpected up close view. Wow."
10,"Rogue One is gritty, charming and exhilarating. Gareth Edwards takes considerable risks in the very first Star Wars spinoff, all to huge success. Whilst the characters are played brilliantly, and the story is thrilling from start to finish, it is the action and the gorgeous look of the film that stand out."
10,"I am an old fan since before the Prequel Trilogy, and this Prequel Trilogy never enjoyed me a lot. I was disappointed by Episode 7. Where was the Star Wars spirit ? And then, I saw Rogue One. For many reasons, this is an excellent Star Wars. The scenario is very well-written, with a lot of unexpected developments. Special effects are very satisfying excepted for two characters. It doesn't affects the global felling however. Let's say it all : there's despair, hope, glory and emotion, humor, with a lot of winks towards all the other episodes. Most of all, this episode fit between espisodes 3 and 4 is perfectly articulated and acts as a real connection. I'm fully convinced this is a real Star Wars episode and should be seen by any fan or anyone else interested in Star Wars. I really enjoyed the show and the universe depicted. It looks believable and esthetically in absolute harmony with the 'old' Star Wars movies, even if new ships are shown and new heroes too. There's also this specific and so appreciated urban chaos and crowds full of aliens on multi-storied cities. But you also get a lot of urban wars and exciting space fights.To be honest, even the end of the movie will keep your breathe until the very last second. Impressive until the end, graphically and scenaristically. That's all, just a very good Star Wars an old fan appreciated a lot. It's clearly impossible to do better than that. Great job guys ! Shall all the following episodes be done like that !"
10,"This Movie is a love letter to the originals and fills the gap on why the Death Star was able to have such a weakness.I love this movie plain and simple its a Star Wars movie done well and you must go and see it for yourself!!!GOOOOOOOOOOOO WATCH IT ****DO IT!"
10,"An adult Star Wars. Rougher, grittier and more courageous than any other I've seen. I hadn't expected this movie to be as meaty as it was, significantly better than The Force Awakens. Vader is at his most menacing since I was in short pants.The space battles are the best they've ever done. The CGI to revitalize Cushing and Princess Leia is pitch perfect.On the day of Carrie Fisher's death, may she rest in peace, I'm giving Rogue One a 10"
10,"My favorite Star Wars movie. I love this movie because; darker and more real.birth of Death Star. Very scary Darth Vader. very scary laser from Death Star. no happy ending. sad ending.    I don't enjoy lightsaber battles, I enjoy seeing people killed by Darth Vader with lightsaber. People try to survive and escape from Darth Vader. People try to survive and escape from laser from Death Star. There should be movies like this not like Star Wars 1,2,3,7. There should be Star Wars every year. I can't wait."
10,"No spoilers. Rogue 1 is the true awakening of the force. While last years cash grab made all 6 previous movies pointless, all our favorite heroes dirty and all their sacrifices and struggle irrelevant Rogue 1 only makes original trilogy better by explaining some important plot holes (boy how many hours did we spend with friends laughing about how stupid constructor of a Death Star must have been to build so vulnerable station  well Rogue 1 has the last laugh!).  It must have been made by true fans of everything that made original Star Wars great and not by some childish pretender who can only see the surface and doesnt understand the essence. This movie is with The Force and The Force is with the Rogue 1. Beginning may be a bit slow for some people used to todays action movies in which plot is only an excuse for some pointless combat but I myself prefer this kind of film structure in which first you have to learn why people do things they do. Finale on the other hand has no equal. And Im not only referring to other Star Wars movies. It was so spectacular that I couldnt sleep that night when I came back from the cinema. When I close my eyes I see magnificent scenes from Rogue 1. I watched original trilogy dozens of times, some scenes hundreds of times , I watched flawed prequel trilogy a lot too and it also had some good scenes, and while I will maybe never watch Force Awakens again I know that I will be rewinding Rogue 1 and watching some moments over and over again.There is nostalgia in this movie but its not there just to trick you into liking this movie. Its there because it truly is real original great Star Wars movie in its very core, you could literally make smooth transition between last scene of Rogue 1 and first scene of New Hope and you almost wouldnt notice that another film just started (and thats what Im intending to do when Rogue 1 comes out!). Its also great standalone film. You dont have to know anything about other Star Wars movies to enjoy it and it makes it even better for Star Wars fan. When someday I will show my child Star Wars I would now have to decide if just maybe I should start with Rogue 1.It really pains me to watch most of action movies, as often it seems that screenwriter was the worst payed person in whole crew. In Rogue 1 I would really have to search hole in whole to attack a plot. Story was really solid and could stand on its own even if it wasnt set in Star Wars universe. As I mentioned above movie explains some questions concerning New Hope and some quite familiar characters (one in particular), we can also see even more of how tyrannical Imperial regime really was, we learn that Rebellion also isnt a monolith but quite interesting group of people with different approaches. Humor was well placed and paced and unconstrained. It wasnt one liner fest. I feel that every dialogue had sense and it was there for some reason. There was even one inspiring speech which actually inspired me! Usually in moments like these are tedious, but when Jyn was delivering her speech she was making sense and her arguments were convincing.Soundtrack was ok it did its job and I know it was there which I couldnt really say about previous movie. For me Star Wars was literally a space Opera or rather space symphony. I was watching beautiful scenes with no dialogue enjoying music and sights. And Rogue 1 has that quality too. Sights are magnificent, when spaceship is flying, even in battle you can see it clearly, camera doesnt fly like crazy, you can really see whats going on. I dont know if it was just me but I also really liked ships landing scenes or when the ship flies by I find it very aesthetic and majestic and Rogue 1 has plenty of this awe inspiring moments and also plenty of great fight scenes.Actors do a very good job, I really liked main cast a lot. Forest Whitaker was a bit overplayed, but on the other how do you not overplay a madman? Diego Luna was excellent as ruthless rebel driven by revenge, Donnie Yen was adorable human Yoda and like no other he showed us The Force really exists. After watching trailers I had many doubts to Felicity Jones as her character seemed too audacious and disrespectful with all this I rebel! etc. and I really want my heroes to care for what they do and be afraid to die, because if they dont care why should I? But I was wrong, she was simply great. And she wasnt some MaRey Sue either. I also had doubts about main villain but he was just repulsive enough to be believable and not some childs vision of how mad space nazi would behave. CGI characters could have been made better, but I my fiance who didnt grow up with Tarkins face said she didnt notice he was CGI character.I cant wait for more movies by the authors of Rogue 1 it is without a doubt the best movie of this year and I couldnt honestly say that any of the original trilogy films is better that Rogue 1."
10,"The Force Awakens was a total letdown last year but I have to say that this time Lucasfilm (Disney) did a great job. Rogue One is just amazing. Seriously go out and watch it becouse it deserve it, it's a true Star Wars movie. It's a story of hope, a story of sacrifice for the greater good against the odds and oppression and I really loved the way the characters are well developed and plausible this time.Also, even if there isn't (almost...) any lightsaber in it, still it shows us the force in a way that is so much better and convincing in comparison to what jj Abrams did in Episode 7, which totally broke my suspension of disbelief.Both Visual and audio are stunning.The ending is very climactic and the final battle (space and land)is just mind blowing.I do believe that this movie totally embrace the spirit of the Rebel Alliance. Finally!"

This was an excellent movie that fits in well with the Star Wars Saga. It is a far better movie than the horrible episode 4 remake known as The Force Awakens!

10,"If you're an original trilogy purest this movie will hit you in the gut and hold you enthralled for just over two hours. THIS is the Star Wars movie we've been waiting for since 1985.While not perfect, it is the perfect antidote to the last four weaksauce episodes (yeah, I'm talking to you too Force Awakens). I cheered, I cried, my mouth dropped in awe. I fell in love with Star Wars all over again, something I'd written off as impossible. As a previously bitter fan, this one movie has instilled within me the driving theme of this wonderful film, hope."
10,"WHAT I LIKED: Wow, forget the rumours, 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is not only a lesson in how to make a proper Star Wars prequel; it's also a bloody great piece of film in itself. Firstly, the prequel box is ticked extremely well, as it really adds weight to the original trilogy; bringing sudden meaning to the words 'rebellion' and 'Empire' in Episodes IV, V and VI. Also, as any good prequel should, it credits the originals whilst moving forward in an exciting visual and tonal direction (just as The Force Awakens did) with real darkness overlayed by a kind of unexpected Spielberg magic. But that's not the most vital thing; where 'Rogue One' shines most is on its own, as this is a truly emotionally engaging and genuinely poetic film that just feels so damn REAL. Why? Well perhaps most importantly, I felt I understood and attached to each character on an incredibly intimate level. Of course this is partly down to how rounded the characters are with the great writing, direction and performances, but it's also because each one is so connected and relevant to the story which brings the whole experience back to the little guy. In fact, I guess that's what this whole thing is about; an especially intimate tale of a few guys fighting for what they believe in. What's so special about it is that intimacy - you're there with them through all their highs and lows and through every incredible action sequence. This feeling is only enhanced by some of the best world building I've ever seen and some amazing practical and computerised effects (I can barely tell the difference), and in the end I found myself so absorbed that I forgot I was watching a film at all. I cried, I smiled, I felt scared and I got the goosebumps, but Gareth Edwards not only hooked me; once I was there I also found a story that inspired genuine hope in me. That's a rather rare and exceedingly beautiful thing, but it makes 'Rogue One' the ultimate film to watch whatever mood you're in. Stick it on and you can escape and enjoy the humour and the best Star Wars action of all time, but at it's core this is a film that captivates and takes your emotions on a ride. That's how you make a bloody great film.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The pacing is a bit jarring at the beginning. That's literally it.VERDICT: I love this movie. 'Rogue One' hooked me and took me on one of the biggest emotional roller coasters I've ever had at the cinema. Well done Gareth Edwards, this is a very self-assured film indeed."

This movie is one-off star wars movie, one of the best in the franchise, far superior to episode 7 in every way possible.  Everyone involved in this movie should be involved in every star wars movie from here on."

10,"The only thing I didn't like a bit that the characters died... Besides that, the movie was great, and maybe it's as good as The Empire Strikes Back!Rogue One is better than The Force Awakens, Disney has learned their lesson (The Force Awakens is good too, but I agree that it was kinda like 'A New Hope II').However, I miss one thing from the new Star Wars movies: 'calm parts', when there is no running away from enemies and things like that, namely when there is no action (the best example is when Yoda is teaching Luke in The Empire Strikes Back)...After all, I'm hyped for the upcoming Star Wars movies!"

Loved it. Was a much better Star Wars movie than 'the force awakens'. This is the Star Wars movie many of us have been waiting for. Darker and more real. Will definitely see it again at the movies. 10/10

10,"The Force Awakens was not the sequel expected by the 'original trilogy generation', but it is still a great movie and I love it. Actually, now we are learning that every new trilogy is built for a new generation. My seven years old son loves TFA much more than any other SW movie. Like prequels were the best ones for the kids that grew up with them. Some are better, some worse, so subjective in some cases, all them are Star Wars, I just enjoy it.Rogue One is really a new paradigm. It's a branch in a new direction, in a wider angle.I enjoyed Rogue One in a new level, different. It's so fresh as classic, so funny as heartbreaking, so old as new. It's awesome. Tasty. I love every character from this movie. It's a story about the real war of the stars, the war of the people who dies for the cause. It was necessary to explain Star Wars from this point of view.To me, Rogue one is 10/10 as a movie."
10,"Although I am very biased attitude to Star Wars, and for me this whole saga is a favorite in the world, but still, being objective, I would say simply - it's the top !!! !!! Vader is gorgeous! The film breaks all the templates just modern cinema, as well as sets a new quality standard for Star Wars! I tell you, as a man, very well versed in this universe - Seventh episode was excellent intonation of a new trilogy, but this film, from which there is little waiting, could overshadow the seventh episode, and I hope it will serve as a good benchmark for this movie in this universe to which the directors will seek the following episodes! Bravo! 10/10! Everyone is required to view, even if you're not a fan, because the cost to join the great saga !!!"
10,"Little note: my review will be spoiler-freeHOLY S--T! What I just saw blew me away. What I came out of was 'Star Wars' at it's best. 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is, IMHO, now the TRUE best Star Wars film since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Set before the original 'Star Wars' from 1977, this film shows us a true WAR in 'Star Wars' by having spies of the Rebel Alliance go up against the evil Galactic Empire to steal the plans to their original Death Star. And, since Gareth Edwards, the director of this movie, really wanted to deliver a war film set in the Star Wars universe, akin to 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Black Hawk Down', he was telling the truth coming out of what I saw. It really feels like a Star Wars movie in a whole new way. I will admit that I enjoyed 'The Force Awakens', but, after a while, I've come to realize that while it is watchable, it feels safe in some ways. This one, really showed how original, different and new it was while being familiar when it knew too and it payed off big time in what I consider it's most serious, if not darkest, Star Wars ever. The entire cast of this movie shines. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, our lead hero with strong brashness but such vulnerability you can't help but feel bad for her when you see how things play out for her in the film, especially with her father Galen (played by the always devious yet charming Mads Mikkelsen). Diego Luna puts effort into his role as Cassian Andor and makes it as memorable as his character's arc in the film is. Riz Ahmed really shows how conflicted his character, Bodhi Rook, is as he delivers playing a former Imperial cargo worker now struggling to redeem himself. Donnie Yen,' and Jiang Wen are awesome as the pair of Force-believing warrior Chirrut Imwe and trigger-happy gun-wielding Baze Malbus. And, Alan Tudyk as the sarcastic reprogrammed droid K-2SO rounds out the cast to help make this movie work in their best way and they all get moments to shine in such iconic ways. Ben Mendohlson really showed his determination playing Orson Krennic in a different kind of villain for 'Star Wars' to show. Darth Vader when he shows up really shows in this time where the film is set, he really is the Vader everyone grew up with. But, I cannot get off the hook without saying how impressed I am by Forest Whitaker's performance of my most anticipated character from this movie, Saw Gerrera from 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars'. While he was in this movie for more or less of what I expected, Forest Whitaker REALLY got into character as Saw and portrayed him in all the ways he was portrayed when we first saw him in 'The Clone Wars'. Also, if you generational Star Wars fans are hoping for ties to the Prequel Trilogy instead of just the Originals, well you're in luck, as we get appearances of not just characters and actors from the Prequels but also planets from the Prequels as well. We also visit new planets that help expand many parts of the Star Wars mythology such as where people stand in believing the Force and what it took to build the Death Star. Plus, be on the lookout for appearances and mentions of certain characters and ships from 'Star Wars Rebels', which you can watch on Disney XD, when it returns with new episodes in January. Also, two important characters from the Original Trilogy make a return in some of the most well-made VFX ever put to film. I'm not spoiling who they are, so, you'll just have to watch for yourself. And, you'll feel like you're part of the action especially once you get to the epic space battle in the climax of the movie. Finally, Michael Giacchino really delivered with his score for this movie that really brings out the action and emotional development these characters go through to complete their mission as well as bringing something new to score in 'Star Wars' while sprinkling familiar scores when needed. Overall, if you're looking for a phenomenal 'Star Wars' film, 'Rogue One' is that. It truly delivers on taking huge risks, like abandoning the traditional opening crawl, and finding its place into the 'Star Wars' universe while remaining a standalone movie that really doesn't need to setup anything for the future of 'Star Wars'. And, that's good. I hope this movie is successful enough to do more riskier Star Wars spinoffs, especially if Episode IX is the last of the core Star Wars saga. I hope you all love this film, because I most certainly did. This film is for all generations of Star Wars fans. Go see it. You'll be glad you did. 5 stars. 10/10"

10,"Best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back. This was a return to the very first two movies back in the 70s, a tribute to the best of this franchise and the kind of Star Wars saga we all came to love. A host of new characters was quite successful and the humor wasn't left out either. It also fills in a lot of gaps from the original films. Oh, and your favorite all time villain, complete with the voice of James Earl Jones, makes a few appearances.Those who didn't give this event top end reviews are in immediate need of CPR."
10,"The fact that this movie is rated lower than the 'Force Awakens' disheartens the credibility of all professional critics; this movie was epic to say the least. By far the most realistic and possible the most moving Stars Wars movie ever produced; providing an extremely well integration of the first and second trilogies. This movie had absolutely no appeal no the 'stupid humor' or 'cute' appeal often found in the other Star Wars films. After watching the film for the second time, I can state that this is probably my favorite Star Wars film ever produced; due to its new definition of the force and the unstoppable force reprimanded by the empire and specifically Darth Vader. The almost impossible feats accomplished by the rebels, reinforces the 'underdog' feel of the rebel alliance provided in the original trilogy while also explaining how the force controls the fate of the galaxy. This film also had noticeable political claims which makes stand on almost the same level of greatness as the original film 'New Hope'."
10,"A definitely top tier Star Wars movie. It gives you plenty of new characters to fall in love with in the Star Wars universe while plenty of returning characters for your nostalgia. I love the work on Moff Tarkin, I swear it was Peter Cushing back from the dead. A recommend, especially for the Star Wars fan."

10,"Rogue one is awesome it's simply amazing, Darth vader was awesome as usual i swear on my life that I never saw Darth vader so bloody and brutal as in the last scene, it's awesome Rogue one always gonna find a place as the best STAR WARS prequel.P.S: R.I.P Carri fisher for his last scene in the movie :')"
10,"People are unbelievable with their ratings.  Force Awakens was a joke.  This movie is true to the Star Wars saga. I hope Disney keeps this Director for all future Star Wars movies. The only flaw I saw in this movie was Orson Krennic whose acting and speech pattern was a bit silly. Other than that, the movie was awesome!"
10,"Rogue One: a Star Wars Story is a movie far different that anythingthat has ever been released under the lucasfilm name. It is completelydevoid of a crawl at the beginning for one thing; Instead it startswith a concussive sforzando of the score, and space flashes onto thescreen, as if to say, 'Here it is, what else did you expect?' I lovethose bold yellow words as much as the next guy, they function as acall to adventure, an invitation to a place far different from anythingthe viewer is used to. But Rogue One is different: it's a lot lessadventurous and far more familiar than the galaxy far far away has everbeen. I mean this in the most complimentary way possible; this is afilm that puts the War in 'Star Wars' in an acute fashion. Rogue One's main strength is its action. In this reviewers humbleopinion, it features the best action the franchise has to offer. Beforeyou cry 'Blasphemy!' and slam the computer shut in rage, allow me toexplain myself. The battle of the death star in Return of the Jedi isprobably the original trilogy's best space combat. It provides avigorous depiction of spacial warfare, displaying the speed and chaosof ship to ship combat. It is, however, fettered by the primitivity ofearly 1980s special effects. The Force Awakens brought to the tablemodern effects, but was fairly unexciting to watch due to its being anear carbon copy of the battle in IV. The battle that serves as RogueOne's climax is an all-new concept. Things like planetary shield gates,message transmissions, and ramming ships are brought in the picture.Aided by 15 or so visual effects companies Disney recruited, it looksconsiderably excellent as well.  Many aspects of A New Hope are also addressed. The conveniently placedexhaust port is no longer a shoehorned plot device, but a final act ofrevenge by a defecting engineer. Tarkin isn't a Grand Moff but a lowlyGovernor, and we get to witness his ascension to power firsthand. DarthVader also plays a fairly major role in the film. Many have criticizedEdwards for his habitation of barely three scenes, but really, thismakes them special. Lack of cinematic appearance for the last 34 yearsmakes it that much more exciting. I struggled in containing myexcitement when I heard that mechanical rasp coming out of the pitchblack hallway of the rebel cruiser in the last scene. After all thosewarnings about cell phones, I figured a boisterous scream of childlikeglee would probably be frowned upon in the establishment. When Vader'scrimson blade appeared, spreading the faces of the trembling rebelsoldiers and the hallway of that ship in rufescent, evil glow, I wasactually shaking with anticipation. Vader precedes to hurl himself uponthe hapless rebels with wieldy might. The rebels rush back, handingoff the sought after plans from man to man, as Vader slashes, chokes,and tosses through their ranks with ease. In a moment of perfection,the trooper hands off his precious cargo to a CG Princess Leia. 'Whatdid they bring us?' he says. 'Hope' she replies. Needless to say, Ialmost cried.  As I exited the theater, barely keeping my balance after listening toGiacchino's brilliant overture, I overheard a woman talking withdissatisfaction about the movie: 'I guess it was good, it was kind ofdepressing though. I mean, they all died, right?''WRONG!' I wanted to scream. Yes, they all die, but in a blaze ofglory. Each character receives the fitting end that I only wish HanSolo had been given. Countless rebel giants fall, fighting for therebel cause. Bohdie the pilot dies wiring an antenna, Baze Malbus dies
fighting with newfound acceptance of the force, and Cassian and Jyn die
having passed on the death star plans. While nothing else can ever fill
the place the original trilogy holds in my heart, I must admit no other
Star Wars film has ever portrayed, at least this powerfully, the theme
of sacrifice, and how it can pave the way for a new hope."

It is weird to talk about a realistic feel.. but stil it has a more realistic feel to the characters than before. it has darker tone (like Empire strikes back) and in my opinion it makes you invest more in the film as you watching it makes the story matter, it gives you chills down your spine as a randon cgi ship blows up... which i personally thinks is amazing! It would really like to se even more of this natural gritty and realistic vibe in the star wars universe! i dont think this film is a 10 maybe 8 or 9 but il give a 10 as i hope it might push the money-men interest in making star wars film in this deriction"
10,"So, I saw 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' last night and I was actually very impressed. I read a lot of reviews before I actually went and saw this film. So while reading these reviews I was beginning to become skeptical myself, they ranted and raved about how the Disney keeps introducing planets and characters that they want us to fall in love with or force upon us and have never heard of. This is a side story all on it's own, so we are going to meet characters that we don't know, we are going to see planets that we haven't seen before, and that is ok.'Rogue One' is probably the best Star Wars film since 'The Empire Strikes Back', it leaves us right where it is supposed to chronologically in the saga. It has you pulling and falling in love with all the characters for the most part. The little cameos that we see here and there are well placed to give you that little nostalgia feeling.If we all remember in 'Episode IV: A New Hope' where the leader of the Rebel Alliance Mon Mothma says that a lot of people had lost their lives to recover these plans. Well 'Rogue One' is the story behind what she was talking about.Jyn Erso the daughter of Galen Erso, was played by Felicity Jones, an English actress known for playing the role of Jane Hawking in the film 'The Theory of Everything' in 2014. I am sure now she will be known as the actress who starred in 'Rogue One'. She played the role with poise and gumption, bringing the character to life with the strength that her character stood for in the saga. We first meet her character at an adult age when she has already been captured by Imperials and is then 'liberated' by members of the Rebel Alliance. Those Rebels would be Cassian Andor and K-2SO played by Diego Luna and the delightful Alan Tudyk. Diego Luna plays a rough around the edges and very secretive scoundrel role in this film, where you don't know if he is good guy or bad guy, while Alan Tudyk plays his sarcastic and very blunt comedic sidekick that is sure to leave you laughing and begging for more.If you are going to go see this film, keep an open mind that this is a story that we knew little of, and that Disney did a great job bringing this story to life and giving us more of an insight on what the Rebel Alliance went through to overcome the great evil that was the Empire.This movie isn't meant to be compared to any of the other episodes that we have seen in previous years. It is to tell the prequel story of the most beloved Trilogy of all time. So don't go to this film with doubts, go to see this film with the hopes to catch a glimpse of something you have never seen before, there are no preconceptions of what to think, because this is a whole brand new story, so you can take it for what it is for, a wonderfully filmed movie, with characters you can connect with for the first and (spoiler alert) the last time.The film has everything, AT-AT's, AT-ST's, sarcastic droids, Dog Fights, real plot lines and a grand finish! A must see in theaters, don't wait to Redbox this movie, you need to go see it in theaters to appreciate it's full value.I hope this review was helpful, and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.Vader is still a beast!-Devin of All Things Nerdy"

10,"Rogue One is the prequel Star Wars deserves.And a thing to note is that the original trilogy has a tone of ingenuity. On the other hand, for Rogue One the tone align to a struggling new found hope. And that is what make Rogue One exceptional. That filme shows the fight and the struggle to build the ground from where the NEW HOPE could flourish, through a boy ingenuity in Episode IV.The heroes in Rogue One are much like the soldiers who fought and died in the beachs of Normand to build the ground for the Alied campain and victory against the nazis in WWII."

As a Normal space battle flick ii.As a star wars movie.2.This is 2 hours of a climactic, heart-wrenching, no **** straight to the point event. Yes, I saw this movie as a star wars movie 'cause I know the story lines and characters.3.MACHINES USED: X-wing fighters, U- wing fighters, Y- wing fighters, imperial I- class star destroyers, TIE-strikers, Resistance star destroyers,{ AT-ACT, AT-ST} walkers: cargo carriers, clone-tank.TROOPERS USED: storm-troopers, death-troopers, shore-troopers, and sand-troopers.4. This story is about the bunch rebellions named Jyn-Erso, Captain Cassian Andor, Chirrut Imwe, Saw Gerrera, K-2SO(actually an imperial reprogrammed machine). Bodhi Rook. named Rouge-One. these five people will make you tear up for sure, awesome char' build-up. The movie is all about stealing plans located at SCARIF(kyber crystal refining planet) from imperial and transmitting it over to rebel-alliances. If you know about the star wars- a new hope(1997), you see Princess Leia handing the death star plan Chip over to R2-D2. 5. Tone and cinematography of the movie is gorgeous, exclusively there's a char who's blind and the way camera angle is set when he senses the movement is gorgeous, even the hyperdrive chills jus chills the way fighters arrive, ships arrive, are awesomely shown.6. There's no point in discussing the story, it's better to acknowledge the way story is executed 'cause story is straight to the point.The execution is way better, way courageous than Star Wars VII : the Force Awakens. 7. I loved this movie to the core, it's heart-breaking and hope-bringing. The third act will BLOW- YOUR MIND. 8. Darth Vader OMFG he is damn terrifying. Princess Leia is CGI of the younger version. In the end when they ask what is this ? while giving the chip.She replies HOPE. SNAP END CREDITS. GOOSEBUMPS.VERDICT: Go, watch it, Irony I walked all the way to my home from the stop chanting ' I am the force, and the force is with me' you'll get the reference after the watch. Way Way better than Star Wars VII. I loved it to the core"

And then we have a bit of story genius that explains the Death Stars weakness. It loses momentum during the middle section which lagged a bit in my opinion. But that's soon forgotten as the action ramps up in the third act for some majorly exhilarating s***. I'm up off my chair in the last 2 minutes as you know who turns up.

Whilst it does have you asking 'why did they do that?' a few times, it does little to detract from the enjoyment of the film and I am sure that if one put a little thought into these decisions they could be justified.

10,"This movie was a big surprise.  Wasn't expecting much.  Liked the characters a lot.  The story was well told and the use of CGI for some characters from previous movies was very cool.  It makes Star Wars A New Hope even better.  It was my favorite movie of 2016.  I admit to be being a star wars fan, but I am impartial enough to say that the prequels (except for this one) were generally terrible.The movie explains a lot, including how the empire could make a death star weapon with an exposed flaw.  It also explains perfectly the plot of A New Hope."
10,"I give Rogue One a 10; perhaps it is a bit generous as I have been praying for a darker Star Wars movie for a long time (incidentally, about the same time I discovered Knights of the Old Republic). The casting was excellent, and I can't really think of a major flaw worthy of taking a mark down on the score. Of course, those who cry that their favorite characters died at the end of a good movie will find plenty of reason to go from 10 to 0 real quick, it was to be expected considering you never see or hear of these characters after this event in the Star Wars universe. I mean seriously, guys, Star Wars itself ought to have a dark side, too. On a more technical note, the soundtrack fit really well, the pacing felt right and flowed naturally to me, the cast was great (especially Donnie Yen), and I did feel a certain tension and excitement to see it through to the end. I've mulled it over since seeing it last night and this movie did what Star Wars has needed to do for awhile: take a chance, a risk; Star Wars needed to branch off from showy lightsaber duels and bland character development and be rich, explore ambitions, explain stories and give viewers a reason to care. It did just that, hence many of the negative reviews for having killed off most of the cast by the end. Turns out, not everyone can handle a darker Star Wars, but if that's what you've been after for years like many others, you should not miss this movie. It only scratches the surface on what Star Wars movie producers and directors need to do, but it's a start and a pretty good start, too."
10,"When I went into episode 7, with high hopes of a new star wars trilogy being great, my hopes were ruined. The movie was bland, the characters;boring and unoriginal, and there was a constant use of pointless nostalgia. It was awful, so going into this film my expectations were set low. However the movie had good characters, amazing scenes, a fantastic plot, amazing moments, and it was a star wars movie through and through. For that alone it could easily get 7 stars, but the ending was astonishing, and for that superb ending it is a must see.Now let us all hope that episode 8 will follow this and not the joke that was episode 7."
10,"Finally, a new Star Wars with dialogue! Great cast and balance of special effects. SPOILER: its both light-hearted and deeply dark; at times has the feel of episode V. Appearances by Vader will pull at your hidden dark side. I'll probably never watch The Force Awakens again, but this I'll rewatch forever..."
10,"This is a Star Wars Movie that shows the true power of the Dark Side of the Force!    -lORD vADER"
10,"What an astonishing film! Rogue One is not only in the second place of the best Star Wars film ever created, after Episode IV And V, but one of the most epic movies ever filmed. Long shots and beautiful shot angles that reminds Peter Jackson's The Lord Of The Rings, epic music-score, fantastic battle sequences, great humor, incredible cinematography, amazing characters and a very emotional end. Rogue Ones last 5 minutes is one of the best endings in cinema history. Is a cinematic wonder that easily earns the title of the best movie of the 2016 and one of the best sci-fi/fantasy films in cinema world!"

I loved loved loved this Star Wars movie better then the force awakens and all other Star Wars films it was certainly a tradgety and didn't follow any formula but I loved it a lot go and see it as soon as you can leave now and see it!!!
"
9,"This movie was much better than Episode 7. No giant idiotic plot choices like Starkiller Base and they didn't forget to do world building either. It greatly enriches Episode 4 and Star Wars in general, though I do wish we had more time with many of the characters.Best Star Wars movie since Episode 6, in my opinion. I cannot recommend it enough."
9,"Great movie compared to the most recent star wars titles.im 42 so i grew up with the originals, which ofc are legends for me.this tilte is more mature and realistic then all the previous titles, i liked the fact there is no clown-characters, i liked very much the plot and many aspects of the setting which are at laest a bit more 'realistic' then what was used to be in the franchise.Dont want to spoil cause here is still on theaters... anyway i like every direcotor choice in this movie.Its defo a great movie, i could not expect somethign better afeter seing episode VII, which was not bad but not great either.."
9,"After a ho-hum Episode 7 that rehashes the plot of Episode 4, I wasn't sure I had much faith left in Disney's ability to resurrect this franchise and push it forward. Rogue One has completely changed my mind on that. One can make a case that the first 30 minutes of the movie are a bit forgettable but ultimately they create the groundwork for the rest of the film, which connects phenomenally with Episode 4's first moments. Where Rogue One succeeds over Episode 7 is the visceral feel of the film. This is absolutely a space epic with futuristic technology and tons of gloss but somehow it all comes off with a little grit and loads more adventure than last year's Episode 7. Rogue One shows that there are stories worth telling in between the major events seen in each Episode film. Even if you're not an avid Star Wars fan, you can appreciate what Rogue One is, but tuned-in fans will love seeing several familiar faces of the early Rebellion. Whatever the next Star Wars film is, bring it one!"
9,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a truly excellent entry into the franchise that even outshines the prior 'Force Awakens'. Risks are taken, new ground is covered and excitement is served up in spades. Perfectly cast and directed, Rogue One immediately takes it's place as one of the better Star Wars films out there."
9,"This might as well be my favorite Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back.  It was absolutely refreshing to have a story that is not focused on an overpowered force-wielding protagonist, but on characters a little bit more normal.  The plot is a little more interesting this time around, with plenty of action to be had."
9,"Well, I'm really waiting for this movie. I waited a very dark and adult story. And I get it. Yes, the first half of the movie is too much boring and tighten but then the narrative accelerates twice and actions happened is too fast. And of course about battles. It a one of the massive battles in Star Wars saga, I enjoying of every single minute."
9,"Probably the best Star Wars film I've ever seen and the best film I've watched this year. Bold, engrossing, tense, and very well put together. Light-years ahead of what I thought it would be. Acting from all main characters is strong, story is generally well thought out and paced. The humour parts are subtle and not overdone or childish.The villains are exceptional and Darth Vader in particular is genuinely 'scary', his limited screen time is still very effective.Overall Rogue One has a serious tone to it which suits the film and franchise very well (as opposed to childish crap that plagues some previous ones). You genuinely care for their fate and the task at hand (to get the Death Star files which expose its critical weaknesses). At no point during the film did I feel bored or wanting it to hurry up, in fact I could have sat for at least another hour! Very well balanced and paced.The film is leaps and bounds ahead of The Force Awakens and previous recent star wars films.I rarely write reviews but felt this one deserved it.More please."
9,"After watching this film I am elated. Here I am thinking that Disney ruined the originality of Star Wars for me by making the no risk, recycled, nothing new 'Farce Awakens'. To be sure, I had a bit of skepticism still when I entered the theater. Would this film cautiously retread the story about some space peasant blessed with magical abilities? Would I have to sit though a nostalgia driven plot that makes no sense? to my relief I was spared any disappointment, and was treated with one of the most originally grounded Star Wars films. The beginning of the movie I felt was the slowest, but before long I was drawn completely into the plot. Then when the action begins it really doesn't stop, right up until the closing scene.It gets a 9 from me for being a truly self contained story, no real loose ends here, just one entertaining ride. -1 point for overdoing CGI a tad , and to all those who called out the music as a negative. At least it had some original scores, and I was able to actually hear it. Unlike in that awful 7th movie..."
9,"
J'ai vraiment aim ce film, un vrai plaisir de voir que la licence Star Wars semble enfin capable de nou faire rver  nouveau ! De l'action comme rarement et les acteurs sont trs bien aussi
"
9,"Just incredible. Reminded me of things that were great about the originals that I had forgotten. This is a masterful star wars film full of feeling and incredibly choreographed battle scenes. It makes the Force Awakens seem bloodless and airless in comparison. The cqi recreations of old actors is the only fly in the ointment. Terrible, terrible decision. Would have been flawless without that."
9,"Look, I'm a massive Star Wars fan, but I've been nothing but disappointed since the mid-eighties really. Episode 7 was somewhat okay for me, but it left a lot of **** in its wake. Rogue One goes about explaining some key things that have left the nerd-verse puzzled about the original Star Wars - Episode IV - A New Hope (as it was later dubbed). Rogue One goes about explaining that and it does so really well and it takes no prisoners."
9,"Rogue One feels more like an exhilarating war film than a Star Wars film, but this is obviously a good thing. The new characters and recognizable cameos are fantastic, the action scenes are top notch, and it is shot extremely well. The film's first third drags a bit and Gareth Edwards' directorial flaws peek in and out, but the rest of the film's pros make up for it. A great addition to the Star Wars mythos and I hope they make more films like this in the future of a galaxy far far away."
9,"As a standalone movie, this is imho the best Star Wars Movie.  The pure action may have been better in Ep 3, the best light saber battle is Ep 1, but those 2 movies were absolute trash.Writing and dialogue are hands down the best out of all the series in Rogue One.  One addition by subtraction is a different reliance on the Force compared to the other films, turning it into a grittier movie and less of a battle of super-beings.  Most importantly, I've now got a new favorite droid.  I kinda wonder what Lucas thinks of all this."
9,"Una buena pelcula con uno de los mejores cierres del universo de Star Wars, -tal vez los mejores ltimos 20 minutos de toda la franquicia-. Es cierto algunas cosas pudieron ser mejor pero como muestra del potencial del Universo De Star Wars es muy buen comienzo y la pelcula es muy divertida."
9,"Rogue One is one of those movies that just gets better and better the more you watch it. Gareth Edward's direction, the cinematography, practical creatures, sets, and especially the CGI, are fantastic and spot on. The characters are great too, you really do begin to feel for them when the scenarios gets serious and dire. Although one could argue they are slightly shallow, its the larger picture of the Rebellion struggling against the Empire that is the true focus. The dark and gritty themes present throughout interplay between both factions, which was interesting to see. Although there are some conveniences here, some scenes feel a but choppy and some of the edits to the movie become a bit apparent, the 3rd act completely makes up for it. It is truly fantastic. Deeply surprised by this movie, and happy to be."
9,"This is hands down the best Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back.  The first time I saw it I was too nervous to really catch all the nuances and finer points of story.  Nervous, yes!  Because I wanted sooooo bad for this movie to make me feel like I did when I was 10 and seeing Star Wars for the first time.Yes, the film is a bit slow at first.  No, the CGI characters are NOT distracting or uncanny.  Yes, you'll long for a bit more backstory on the members of Rogue One, but YES you are supposed to want more!  That's what Star Wars did for us.  OMG, the clone wars?  What were those?  Jedi?  What are you talking about?  Anyway, none of that makes Rogue One less enjoyable.The second time I saw the film I picked up on a lot more clues, and was left overjoyed.  I loved the film even more.  The Force Awakens was pretty good, but this is just shy of spectacular."
9,"Rogue One manages to stay as a faithful chapter from the Star Wars franchise on its own league serving as a rightful prequel to the fourth episode. The creators right from the start had promised to bring something new to the table and they did deliver. The casting was perfect. The CGI has been remarkable with lots of surprise elements in offer for long time fans of the franchise from the 70s. Although the film delivers in the long run with all Stars Wars action elements ranging from stormtroopers to the  AT act walkers against the rebellion units , there are minor issues with general pacing as the story progresses around with its Death Star plot at instances with poorly timed execution of the characters related to it, bogging it down for viewers. The Force Awakens had an USP with great character execution but on the other hand the action sequences in Rogue One struck the right chord several notches above TFA for the prequel story. It deserves a solid 9."

Rogue One is a fitting addition to the Star Wars cannon with a story line filled with interesting characters, captivating moments, and possessing a tragic quality reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back.
"
9,"This is what the Force Awakens should have been. The action sequences are incomparably better than any other in the previous movie. The story line is also way more original, showing other aspects of the rebel alliance. I only felt the characters werent developed very well."

Led by a stellar cast and finalized with some pretty awesome scenes with the one and only Darth Vader, Rogue One serves as a welcomed edition to the Star Wars universe and should please any Star Wars fan, new and old.
"
9,"8.5/10 (Metacritic doesn't let you do decimals)This is my second favorite Star Wars after Empire.  The worst part of the movie is the beginning, and it progressively gets better from there until it's firing on all cylinders by the end.  The final act is spectacular!  Probably the best space battle excepting Jedi, and the best ground fight in any Star Wars.The story is great, and even goes so far to correct a 40-year-old plot hole in A New Hope (I won't explain that further for fear of spoilers).The weak point is the character development.  The two mains, Jyn and Cassian, have decent character arcs.  Chirrut and Baze play two characters that are pretty much cliche at this point, but still enjoyable.  Bodhi is forgettable.  K-2SO is pretty awesome and carries almost all of the comedic relief on his shoulders, and not in the cheesy way the prequels treated C-3PO.  Saw Gerrera played by Whitaker has only a small role in the movie and is involved in probably the weakest scene of the entire thing.There is a lot of fan service in this movie.  Without going into spoilers, some of it works really well and some had me rolling my eyes.They used CGI to bring back two characters from the original trilogy.  One gets a lot of screen time and suffers for it, entering into the uncanny valley.  The other gets limited screen time and works a lot better.I take it by now everyone knows Vader is in the film.  And let me tell you, Rogue One has the best Vader scene in all of Star Wars IMO.  They humanized him in Jedi, but they bring back the menace full on here!I consider this a must-see.  If you're like me, the first 15-20 minutes will leave you pessimistic about the result of the movie, but it'll win you over shortly after that!"
9,"Fr mich einer der besten SW-Filme,weit vor Ep7.Grandiose Kameraperspektiven (z.B. der Sternenzerstrer ber der Tempelstadt).Die Imps treffen zwar immer noch nicht przise,aber wenigstens besser als in den anderen Teilen :-PWas fr ein Schlachtengetmmel und Vader,Tarkin und Leia wiederzusehen war es allein schon wert :-)"
9,"Awesome is only word i can use to describe this masterpiece. It basically a war movie with star wars look. awesome character , great visual effecf and story telling. This movie is prefect missing link between ep 3 and 4. also they add a little of Marvel sense of humor make it ez to watch for new audience . And last but not least Darth Vader super badass in this film. just go to theater and watch it u won't be disappoint"
9,"This is the first time Star Wars really felt like war. By focusing on single mission and battle the stakes of the entire world feel greater in retrospect. Star Wars fans will not be disappointed; it revels in the ambiance of the old films without feeling derivative of them. Might also be the darkest Star Wars film to date, showing why a new hope was really needed. A great way to start off the side films."
9,"Holy F**K Vader!! Oh man I can only look at this movie as a massive fan and as a fan it was amazing. The story was interesting and moved quickly, the cinematography and sense of scope and scale was excellent. I absolutely loved getting to see more of the oppression of the empire and the morally grey areas of the rebellion.I loved the fact that this felt like a war movie taking place in the star wars universe. It connected seamlessly to episode 4 and gave me some truly jaw dropping moments. The whole last half hour of the movie was amazing and the beach scenes were everything I had hoped for in the best saving private  Star wars kind of way. And Vader Holy **** Vader just mercilessly chopping down the rebels in the hallway at the end may have become one of my favourite Scenes ever. All in all I ****ing loved it, I have seen some criticisms of lack of character development ect But I think for the type of single shot story that this is that the way they handled it was appropriate. All in all is it a perfect movieno because no movies perfect. BUT  I would say because of my taste for the darker side of star wars this prob slots in to place behind empire strikes back as my favourite Star Wars movie. I need to see it about 4 more times in the cinema before I set my ranking in stone but the point is  want to see it many more times. This film Gave me everything I wanted and was hoping for in an incredibly satisfying package. Bravo! Job well Done!!!"
9,"Amazing star wars movie, it has his problems but at least is something different, the prequel we deserve, now i have a lot of fait in this new anthology movies. (please check the negative reviews, its incredible how people can be so stupid, i mean i know its their opinion but damn alot of them didnt even know what movie they were watching)"
9,"I would have to say when it comes to this movie. I got everything I ever wanted. I even got the ending I wanted. Sadly this movie does suffer from a few if not nit picks in my opinion. First off when it comes to Tarkin I feel his CGI was not on par with Leias which was perfect. It would have been better if you where gonna have Tarkin in such a role to constantly have his back towards people. I felt that would have been better. The other things was some poor character development. I understand that there fates why develop the characters. Yet literally the only 2 characters from the Rogue One Squadron that I can remember was K2 and Donni Yen. Then the last thing that is the only plot hole in this movie to me at least is why are the Empire looking for Kaber Crystals. It has been cannonized that the Death Star runs off one giant kaber Crystal. So what are they scouring planets for more. Just a nit pick I know. Also there is some poor editing I know it was rushed but there are some scenes where it wasn't edited well.Other then all that I would say this movie is a 9/10 and a must see and must own on blue ray."
9,"The last time the 'Star Wars' franchise decided it wanted to make prequels... we got outraged fans who lost faith in the iconic franchise. Luckily, Gareth Edwards directs 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story', a title that might put-off some fans, but the movie itself is definitely worth a watch. We meet a young girl named Jyn (Felicity Jones) who had to escape after her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) is informed by Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) forces Galen to work on the crafting of the Death Star. After some decade and a half, Jyn meets Rebel Officer Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and she is informed about the Death Star.She also meets a droid named K-2SO (a very funny Alan Tudyk) whose mannerisms and personality seem unusual, but helpful. They travel from planet to planet to find more clues on how to get the plans to destroy the Death Star, and they also find more characters to come and help. There is so much of this movie to talk about, but a 'Star Wars' review can be easily spoiled, so I'm just going to summarize my thoughts on the movie. This is a really steady paced, dark and thrilling movie. The third act is one of the best third acts in any 'Star Wars' movie, ever. The war battle that rages reminded me of the opening battle scene in 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), obviously not that violent, but for this franchise's standards, it is. There are many familiar faces that return in this movie, most notably, Darth Vader (reprising the voice of James Earl Jones), who only makes two small appearances in this movie. But, they are so great, I cannot elaborate further without spoiling it, so I'll leave it there. This movie, which takes place before the events of 'Star Wars: A New Hope' (1977), really relies mostly on story as opposed to character. You get to know a lot about Jyn, a little bit about Cassian and K-2SO... but the rest are kind of glossed over as far as development goes. Director Gareth Edwards did a capable job of actually making this feel like a 'War' movie, whereas the other movies were a space-opera spectacle. The first two acts are a little pacey here and there... but that third act is truly one of the best highlights for this entire franchise."
9,"Rogue one is a dark, gritty and the most realistic movie in the Franchise. A Fascinating Story with Stand-out performances and a Mind blowing 3rd act. Gareth Edwards direction with the Action scenes and VFX is ground-breaking. The only issue with the movie is the 2nd act wasn't structured well."
9,"*Inhales deeply...*Anticipation was very, very high with this new Star Wars offering, though I did attempt to temper my response to this much awaited film. This is an experience that is ultimately worthwhile, though the first two acts had me worried at times. There is an intermittent lack of finesse, both with the CGI and the script, but the performances from Jones, Tudyk and Luna are exceptional. The cinematography is magnificent, delivering the sumptuous visuals we have come to expect from this universe, and the pacing is initially stilted but tightens considerably in the second and third acts. Taking place between the events of 'The Revenge of the Sith' and 'A New Hope', the storyline provides an engaging insight into the perils of war, with a focus on the darker realities of conflict than any other Star Wars film to date. It's in the final act that this film fulfills the heavy responsibility with which it was imbued, and in so doing provides long time fans with an unflinching journey to the heart of the rebellion. Leave the younger kids at home for this one. I am with the force, and the force is with me. 8.96/10"
9,"Who: Felicity Jones, a Spanish guy, and Charles Jefferson as, Saw GerreraWhat: Another reason for butt-hurt Warcraft fans to leave their basement, wash the cheetoh dust from their hands, and trash a movie that is actually pretty greatWhere: A Galaxy Far, Far, AwayWhen (Can I watch this movie again): If you like Star Wars, any time.

9,"People loved The Force Awakens but have problems with this movie? The whole world is insane. Here is a list of things this movie did better than last year's installment. - Actual establishment of the Imperials being in control, and a need for a rebellion/resistance.- A tentacle monster that had an actual purpose.- Actual stakes and a genuine concern that the heroes won't make it out alive.- Intricate exposition not being reduced to ridiculously basic confabulation.- Dialogue that wasn't cheesier than a cheese-plate.- Cinematography that actually shows details of aliens. - Important robot/alien characters (that speak).- Mads Mikkelsen. - Actually having something to do with the original trilogy. I could also reduce this list to two words: Darth Vader."

Just accept it. It's better than The Force Awakens. It maintained it's connection to the originals without beating us over the head with stupid one liners and constantly saying, 'you'll love this because you loved the original movies!'.
"
9,"A fun, exhilarating Disney space adventure. The film works on almost all levels, particularly the CGI created Peter Cushing, Princess Leia, a fantastic final battle and an unforgettable scene with Darth Vader."
9,"This is the Star Wars movie we wanted last year.Instead of checking off a predetermined set of boxes tied to peoples nostalgia and following the contours of an older Star Wars movie, Rogue One focuses on an original, compelling story with the nostalgia interlaced. There were some moments where the drama feels forced (and there was enough of them that it prevented me from giving it a 10), but overall the motivations and desires of the characters are believable. Far from being omni-competent, the actions of the main characters cost them deeply by the end of the movie. I also liked how one of the characters, a droid called K-2SO, provides intelligent humor and comic relief without making a mockery out of himself (the way C-3PO does). And when the nostalgic moments came up with old characters, they feel more natural rather than tacked on.A short note: Its also worth pointing out that the underlying themes in movies can provide passing commentary on the times in which the creators live. The original Star Wars with its original Death Star provided a subtle commentary on weapons of mass destruction during the height of the Cold War and the nuclear weapons age. As I watched this movie and saw the scene where rebels ambushed storm troopers in the streets of a desert city, it made me immediately think of the Syrian Civil War. I dont know if that was done on purpose, but it definitely feels like a powerful, passing commentary on the times in which we live.Moving along, I am pleased that this film puts the Wars back in Star Wars. You wont see any Jedi doing back flips with lightsabers here. Instead, at the end of the movie, there is a very long and intense ground and space battle that defines what Star Wars is all about. It goes back to the Star Wars roots in a way that the Force Awakens tried to do, but fell short on.I hope that the people making Episodes 8 and 9 take note. This may have been an anthology film, but it is hands down the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and has set the new gold standard for what a Star Wars film should look like."
9,"Before I start I have to say I absolutely loathed Force Awakens, a movie which had no respect for the Star Wars universe, and whose writers seemed to think repetition of past plots was a demonstration of love for it. I went to this one expecting to be disappointed, though I hoped the fact it involves no Jedi might actually be its saving grace. It was. There is no character here who, without even being a Padawan, defeats a Sith master both in Jedi mind control and in a light saber duel (the excluding of this possibility is why I suspected it would be harder to stuff up this one). Also, instead of stupidly rehashing the past this instalment nicely interlocks with it (note the distinction J.J., and you critics who uncritically gushed over FA). Consistent with the fictional history, there are no Jedi in sight (since they've all been assassinated or have gone to ground like Obi Wan and Yoda), and the only light-saber youll see is Darth Vader's when he goes on a slaughter fest at the end which nicely dovetails with the beginning of the original movie I saw as a child and was entranced by then. In many ways this is the adult Star Wars we grown up fans of the originals have been waiting for. I only wish the writers of this could have had the making of FA instead of the fool Jar Jar Abrams. Disney, please let them complete the trilogy Abrams stuffed up. They understand what real Star Wars fans want. Something gritty and grown up, which recognises the history and mythology of the SW universe but tells its own story within that context.Felicity Jones is a great actress, and plays a role which is both capable and sensitive. Also, as an Aussie, I'm happy to see Ben Mendelsohn as the central villain; a great actor. For martial arts fans there's the brilliant Donnie Yen, who isn't a Jedi but should be, instead playing a blind, possibly slightly crazy, worshiper of the force, who may or may not be force sensitive but regardless manages to take out a lot of storm troopers and almost magically dodge some blaster fire (and has a friend with a hugely powerful blaster to keep him alive when the odds are too much against him). Chirrut Imwe (Donnie), yes, you are one with the force, you are one with the force (youll get my reference once youve seen the movie). There is a beautifully tragic ending for the central characters too. Heroes die, as they ought to in a good war movie or tragedy.Expect to see some slightly dodgy CGI resurrections, but only when necessary and not to too bad effect. Of course the greatest of all Star Wars villains, Darth Vader, being in his life support suit, doesnt need this kind of treatment and is voiced as always by the inimitable James Earl Jones.I see that this received poorer reviews from the professional reviewers than did FA, to which I can only say these guys must be either corrupt or stupid (or maybe both). Ok, I have suspected that since all the gush over FA, but this round of stupidity confirms it. I have given this 9 instead of 10 because, though it is sensible, consistent, respectful of the past but not slavishly committed to it, and well written, what I would really have loved to see is this kind of loving care lavished on the new trilogy (movies with Jedi in them!) instead of just this (appropriately Jedi free) standalone. If you are a lover of the original trilogy I strongly recommend this one. If you were disgusted by FA I am totally with you (read my review to see how much I hated it), but this one is a different beast. Give it the chance you regretted giving FA. It may not be perfect, but I think it's the best since the original trilogy (and doesn't have the vomitous cutesiness of Ewoks to mar it).Now, where would I start with a remade Episode VII? The remnants of the empire have degenerated into an insurgency against a shakily re-established republic. They are carrying out terrorist attacks across the galaxy. The Jedi academy has been re-established by Luke, and Leia has also had some Jedi training, but perhaps has chosen not to become a full-fledged Jedi because there is so much political work to do patching together a workable galactic democracy. Perhaps Leia, in fighting against terrorists has become a little dark herself (this couldnt reasonably happen with Luke, since he has proved himself capable of resisting the combination of Darth Vader and the Emperor in ROTJ), setting up a sibling conflict of galactic proportions. After all, real politics is a dirty business. She hasnt become Sith but her morality is uneasily balanced. Questionable alliances have been made (think of the mess in Syria at the moment). The line between good and evil is becoming blurred. Luke, as a monk like Jedi figure, has perhaps become morally flawed in a more subtle way, by virtue of a too mystical, navel gazing perspective on right and wrong. An adult premise. Start there screenwriters. Develop."
9,"Rogue One is easily the best movie of 2016. I don't know what movie critics saw , this movie was really good . The trash that was Force Awakens has been erased and has this has  given moviegoers hope in Disney and the Star Wars franchise .JJ Adbrams should be ashamed and embarrassed the trash he put on screen last year."
9,"
Although slow starting, Star Wars: Rouge one has incredible action, acting and, especially towards the end, gripping emotion. Surely Disney can't top this, along with the brilliant episode 7.

9,"I liked the Force Awakens, it had likable characters like Finn, Kylo Ren, and a few others. It lacked originality and just could not grip me as well as some of the others. This movie kicked a**, so much a**, very likable characters, Vader, amazing fights, fun references, Vader, plot twists, Vader, and a logical and emotional conclusion. Cannot wait for more Star wars Spin offs."
9,"Rogue one is perhaps one of the greatest Star Wars film ever made -but not a great film in itself. I agree character and pacing is a bit off, but I think people forget that Star Wars never really had great character development to begin with but rather great actors giving a really good performance (ie Harrison Ford's lines a lot of his one-liners were ad lib). My personal gripe with this film is probably that a lot of the characters felt a bit tagged on - like the blind dude etc, and some of the choices they do (ie in the ending) feels forced and illogical -and could have been written better in terms of what happens to them. The ending is rather unambiguous and a certain CGI character appears too much and does something at the end for no reason (only to ensure there won't be a sequel). Also Gareth Edwards could've shot some of the action scenes better and give some character's a proper arc which was lacking. Lack of a crawl and insistence of using location cards were a bit off-putting.However Rogue One has the best world building, plot development, costume design, lighting and story flow out of the other Star Wars films. The film doesnt rely on wipes to get to one place to another which is great. Rogue one also have amazing action sequences and impeccable sound design. All the locations feel like real worlds compared to Force Awaken (which felt like small set designs). Although the score lacked more distinguishable motifs, I thought it flowed really well with the action o the films - and more of the traditional motifs were integrated well.  Overall I thought Rogue One was a better Star Wars film than TFA and maybe even ROTJ, only because the world building and action was impeccable."
9,"It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empires ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.These words are the first thing that anyone ever saw of Star Wars as the film opened in 1977 and now Gareth Edwards has imbued them fully in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.Hope AnewThe Rebellions struggle just got worse, as it learns that the Empire has created a world-killing weapon named the Death Star. The Rebellion finds itself on the knifes edge between hope and despair. The council of the Rebellion cannot decide what to do. Do they risk it all by trying to steal the plans, or do they resign themselves to defeat and despair? Jyn challenges the council, What chance do we have? The question is what choice. She implores the council to remember that if they do nothing then theyve sealed the fate of the galaxy and that evil this great cannot go unopposed. It brings to mind Edmund Burkes famous saying, The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. She encourages them with a refrain Cassian Andor said to her earlier in the movie, Rebellions are built on hope. Hope changes everything, it reminds people that the way it is, is not how it has to be. Hope is the spark that, if kindled, creates the fire of change. Change is possible, but it takes sacrifice, determination and some times, lives to see it come about.The beauty of the film is that hope is not just a figment of the heroes imaginations. The Force seems quite active, even without the Jedi. Its moving in mysterious ways and bringing people together that can make a difference. This band of rogues does the impossible, one chance at a time, succeeding in their goal and setting in motion something that will see the end of the Empire.The MovieGareth Edwards made a Star Wars movie that feels completely different and yet utterly familiar, all at the same time. Like The Clone Wars, Edwards uses cinematic inspirations to pull in the war movie genre and make it a Star Wars movie, emphasis on the war. The nods to great war films of the past are all there and they work perfectly. On top of that you feel the Star Wars seeping out of every single frame. The Ghost from Star Wars Rebels can be seen at least 4 times, Cham Sydulla is called for over the coms at Yavin 4, the sets feel like they came out of a lost arc of The Clone Wars, Saw Gerrera has an important role and so much more. The point here is that Edwards lovingly knits together the history of the Prequel and the Original trilogy and its seamless.Star Wars, when its at its best, is stretching what it means to be Star Wars by taking other genres and telling a story in the Star Wars universe that aligns with the themes of the saga. Edwards achievement is nothing short of incredible, the movie feels like the Makers fingerprints are all over it and its the highest compliment that could be paid to the movie.The characters are outstanding. K-2so is the best new droid since R2 and Jyn, Cassian, Chirrut, Baze and Bhodi are all welcome additions to the Star Wars canon. Darth Vaders scenes are chilling (and lets stop here and just geek out completely that Vaders castle is finally on screen!) and perfectly played, just enough to leave you wanting more.The music by Giacchino feels like a welcome addition to the Star Wars franchise, its much like The Clone Wars music and only references familiar themes in snippets yet thats a good thing. The movie needed its own identity and the themes he created feel familiar and distinct, perfectly matching the spirit of the movie.Ill get personal, this movie is everything I wanted a new Star Wars movie to be. Pushing the boundaries of what it means to be Star Wars while at the same time respecting the history and the franchise as a whole. Heres to hoping the rumors of Edwards wanting to direct a Kenobi movie are true. Rogue One is rated 4.5 upside down Death Stars out of 5."
9,"Absolutely in the top five Star Wars Movies ever made and a joy to watch from beginning to end.While yes, there are issues with the movie, some of the CGI can be a bit in the uncanny valley the first time you see it and some of the characters are under developed, I don't feel they impact the movie too seriously. The movie ties perfectly into the start of 'A New Hope' and helps to fill in plenty of holes that were in the original movie, such as why Luke becomes 'Red 5', why the Death Star has such an odd weakness and how Vader can be so certain that Leia isn't on a diplomatic mission as she claims.Also, the fact that the Rebellion isn't depicted right out as the good guys in the film, is a massive relief! In all of the original trilogy, the Rebels are shown as the moral right, good guys against an evil empire. But not in Rogue One. Here we see a Rebellion that is on the verge of breaking, taking desperate measures to keep themselves hidden and accomplish their goals in the face of overwhelming odds, where many of their missions are win or die trying.For any Star Wars fans, this is highly recommended that you see it!"
9,"After seeing Kevin Smith's reaction to the movie I immediately went and saw it opening day. What a rewarding experience it turned out to be. While watching the movie I felt somewhat skeptical as to the direction everything was going, but the third act is a breath taking edge of your seat roller coaster ride that delivers on so many levels and ended on such a high note. Totally recommend. Righteous prequel to A New Hope. Do yourself a favor, see this movie in theaters and share the experience with as many people as you know. This movie will be more and more revered for its place in star wars cinematographic entries as time goes on."
9,"SPOILER-FREE REVIEW    A movie from Star Wars universe. Recommended whether you saw any previous SW movies or not.    This movie starts a bit weaker but it becomes an absolute masteripiece by the end! Disney wasn't afraid to go into darker events. Yes, this isn't some happy story, this is a WAR story in Star WARS and it's absolutely amazing.    It has all what I wanted from Star Wars: Space Battles, The Force, cool lovable robots, lasers and explosions, deep characters. The Rebelion is shown from a different perspective - they are good guys, but sometimes they do shady and sad stuff to keep them selves alive. This enriches SW universe, where rebels are mostly shown as only good people.    The models and CGI are absolutely amazing. I had shivers going down my spine when I realized just how big Star Destroyer is and then they show Death Star behind it. I was in awe. Skirmishes are clever and Storm troopers are more dangerous and actualy hit people, especialy the elite back ones. Music on-par with movie quality.    Darth Vader is scary again! The scene with him is so epic and intimidating! I don't give this 10/10 for 2 reasons: 1)Weak start - first 15 minutes of film are not as good as the rest, It starts slowly with a remote family story, whcih I would rate 6/10. 2) A little bit of cliche stuff. Although amazingly well done, its another Death Star plot, and I had enough of Death star plot in SW. Even Force Awakens was enough. People in market agressively bumping character's shoulder and then shouting at them-I saw this in so many films, it's a small one, but I noticed it, among other nit-picks.    Overall it's an amazing Star Wars film and even amazing film on it's own. I totaly recommend it. My final verdict is 9/10 - It's a must see."

Fantstica, lo nico que flojea para mi es la banda sonora pues en algunos momentos no cuadra con lo que esta ocurriendo, por el resto es simplemente maravillosa.
"
9,"Rogue One is the epic story that follows a small group of rebels that steal the plans to the death star. I really liked the cinematography, special effects, action, and overall scope of this film. It is one of if not the most beautiful looking Star Wars movies. Most of the new characters are really good as well and the performances provided by the various actors. The characters that stood out the most for me are Krennic, K2SO, and Chirrut. I wasn't a huge fan of Saw Gerrera and felt like some of the other characters weren't as memorable as I hoped they'd be. But after thinking about it I think thats the point of the story. This group of rebels ended up risking their lives for the greater good of the galaxy, and sometimes not being remembered after the fact is what happens in war. I only have one other main gripe with the film, and it has to do with a CGI character. I liked the writing and performance of the character I am just unsure that it feels organic enough to fit into the story. Overall these few nitpicks aren't really enough for me to feel the film is flawed because it is amazing in every other front. Especially the final act, oh man was it ever worth it. This is the prequel you are looking for."

After the pretty enjoyable, but still just a   copy*multiply+add_old_heroes formula of 'Force Awakens' - looks like we got back on track with this Star Wars Story, though a bit darker, then one may expect.
"
9,"ROGUE ONE REVIEWStar Wars is back and Star Wars is now real force!Where to begin reviewing this movie. It achieves so much within its simplicity and a rather narrow scope of a mission, but manages to expand on the known Star wars Lore by doing so, and introducing us to many new and reminding us of a quite a few old characters, in different scopes of screen time, some important to the plot, others more of fan service, letting us know they do exist in this ever expanding universe.Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso,  Alan Tyduk as K2S0 and Forest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera steal the show. Yes that is that Saw Gerrera to who ever watched Clone Wars animated series.  Felicity Jones carries the entire movie with her conviction and fearlessness. K-2SO provides the most of the part of the comic relief but not in a way that anyone has seen before, think of him as of more cynical version of C-3PO, that way I do not go into much details or spoil much of his character. Forest Whitaker is fantastic as war grizzled Saw Gerrera that shows us just exactly how much war can change anyone, regardless of what side you are on.Another big surprise  in this movie was just how much screen-time was dedicated to the Empire and its characters with Ben Mendelsohn as Commander Krennic, puts a real face to the Empire, and how the people behind it, were as divided and human as any of the other rebel characters. That is probably partially true, as he's one of the only real Imperial characters really developed on screen other than Vader/Palpatine before, and it was very interesting to see that side of the war as well. This is where the movie really shines as well, as it shows that even Imperial officers like him, have their own agendas and dreams.Rest of the cast is very very capable as well with Mads Mikellsen leading the cast as the imperial science officer, and Donnie Yen (Yeah!) as a blind staff wielding warrior, and its Donnie Yen in Star Wars movie, that's all that really needs to be said about that! Rest of the cast is also very capable and the charisma and the connection between these characters is very well established.Gareth Edwards manages to make an adult version of Star Wars not saying the others were not adult oriented movies, but this one is not really relying on humor but establishing the true struggle that rebellion had to do against the Empire. And Edwards manages to do so, without making the movie dreary all the way, managing levity just enough to  keep the story fun and exciting.Another big departure here is that this is the first Star Wars movie not composed by John Williams but Michael Giacchino whose music fits to the feel of this movie, even though there are some famous Star Wars beats in the movie, most of this soundtrack feels very original, and he has put his stamp on the Star Wars universe, which is an amazing accomplishment.Everything about this movie feels authentic, and its really the small things from the aesthetic feel of the movie and how certain shots were framed and how certain sequences were established is done very well, almost as a painting at some points, and there was that scene that was scene with a Star Destroyer, that I believe was shown in trailers, that scene gives you goosebumps.Overall this movie does what a very very few movies can succeed at and that is take established universe, remove most of the main characters from that universe and make a compelling movie, make the universe feel more lived in. Manage to expand on the known universe in such a way that is meaningful, introduce us to some of the new characters that we can cheer for: Either Rebel or Imperial, and as I could believe this is first time that both Rebel Alliance hierarchy is kind of explained, and that adds to their plight.  And this last statement I am going to probably catch a lot of crap for, but I believe it to be true. This movie managed to do an impossible, make an original trilogy even better movies.4 out of 4 stars."
9,"Pretty good movie. Would be a 10 but there are a few major plot holes and some of the writing is left wanting, but overall a fantastic movie. Far better than the SJW propaganda filled Force Awakens. Let's hope the next movie follows this example and sticks to being entertaining and true to the franchise instead of pushing a backwards agenda."
9,"This film got almost everything right.  The plot, special effects, and dialogue are all exceptional.  The one and only complaint that I had when watching this movie was that there were too many operations going on at once, and too many characters were introduced to be killed off within two hours.  All in all, this is a great film, the one Star Wars fans have been waiting for."

Better then the force awakens! A great movie. The best sci-fi movie I have seen recently. Better than arrival, better than star trek, better than star wars episodes 1-3.
"
9,"We are now living in an era where we can look forward to a new Star Wars movie each year. And luckily for us, the two Disney have released so far are amazing. While The Force Awakens was light-hearted like the original, Rogue One takes a darker turn, with a morally ambiguous lead cast and a more realistic war-like feel.The movie follows the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the daughter of an Imperial Scientist, who is unwillingly recruited by the Rebel Alliance to find her father and stop the Empire from unleashing their new planet-killer onto the galaxy. However, as her journey continues, she discovers the Rebel Alliance isnt always quite as heroic as we would like to believe.One of the things that makes Rogue One great is that it isnt black and white. While the Empire is still clearly evil, the Rebel Alliance is also shown to not always make the right choices, and one quote that sums this up pretty well is when Jyn tells Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) You might as well be a Storm Trooper.One thing that surprised me about this movie was just how great some of the performances were. Two actors I think people will be talking about are Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO (the films main source of comic relief). While Tudyk provides plenty of laughs, Jones portrays her characters strengths and flaws perfectly.All right all done here bye-bye!Oh wait. I forgot about the best part of the movie  Darth Vader. Not since The Empire Strikes Back have we seen Vader this merciless and evil. His screen time is limited, but extremely powerful and satisfying (particularly the absolutely badass ending).Rogue One is absolutely one of the best Star Wars movies yet, with a dark story and a great cast of characters. The force is strong with this one!"
9,"Rogue One is a film with plenty of imperfections, but is still an outstanding Star Wars experience when taken as a whole. In this way, it is the most natural addition to the franchise since Return of the Jedi. Uneven pacing and plot holes haunt the legacy of every Star Wars film (even The Empire Strikes Back), yet these stories endure because of unparalleled visual imagination and an unbreakably strong human element. Director Gareth Edwards and writers Gary Whitta and John Knoll all understood this. Combined with intense passion as both artists and Star Wars fans, they sought to create an offbeat tale within the mythos that proved that not every ounce of brand value comes from epic heroes combating the forces of evil with laser swords. In that respect and many others, the production team crushed expectations.For the uninitiated (if there are any left), Rogue One is an ensemble war film, centered on acquiring the Death Star plans. It isnt intended to be optimistic and colorful like a typical Star Wars movie. The atmosphere is grim, depicting a galaxy drained of hope by an oppressive fascist dictator. Here the rebels have to walk on eggshells, working from the shadows to make calculated strikes at the Empire. As a result, the scale is somewhat smaller in this adventure and significantly more personal. Dialog is sharp, carefully representing a small team at odds with themselves. However, there is a surprising amount of levity in the script to offset the otherwise bleak narrative. In particular, Alan Tudyks portrayal of the sarcastic droid K-2SO steals the show. Though Ben Mendelsohn as the self-absorbed Director Krennic and Diego Luna as the morally conflicted Cassian Andor also turn in memorable performances. Yet acting of any quality is no substitute for a compelling plot, which is where Rogue One occasionally loses steam. The first act of the story jumps around liberally, putting crucial details in jeopardy of being lost to all but the most attentive viewers. In the second act, the story grinds to a halt so the female lead can fulfill her arc. It is also where one or two subplots are entirely dropped, leading to unnecessary confusion about the state of a crucial character. In the final act, the story picks up again and ties up every loose end with extraordinary diligence. Rogue One has arguably the most comprehensive and satisfying finale to any Star Wars narrative, including the entire gamut of expanded canon. It is also worth noting that even if the pacing is uneven, virtually nothing is out of context. Contrary to the insultingly shallow exposition of The Force Awakens, everything in Rogue One has a substantial visual or verbal explanation. It helps reinforce the plight of the team and flesh out the world they inhabit. Also, the attention to detail ensures Rogue One will be a pleasure to watch for years to come.To that end, there is an item in Rogue One that will serve as a discussion piece both immediately and well into the future. In the film, a certain character from the original trilogy is recreated with the use of CGI. This is not merely a cameo, he is a fully functional cast member. His likeness, mannerisms and voice were entirely reproduced to fill a role. While it has handled with the utmost taste, the actor in question has been dead for over two decades. This sets a dangerous precedent not just for Star Wars, but for the future of filmmaking. Hollywood is desperate enough to remake any film from yesteryear, though now they can also remake people. While currently a gimmick with frightening potential, these techniques could one day become a crutch to the creatively bankrupt. Hopefully Lucasfilm and Disney discourage widespread adoption of this approach.Beyond that ethical quandary and a few missteps, Rogue One needs little improvement. A directors cut of the film with touched up editing would address the vast majority of complaints. The first act could slow its breakneck pace and add a bit more articulation to each action sequence. Cut content could be added back into the film to minimize the confusion caused by the dead ends in subplots. Perhaps a few more establishing shots on the tropical planet of Scariff would better emphasize how visually diverse and interesting it is from other locales in the Star Wars universe. Certainly the score could be more melodic, even if Michael Giacchino did do a phenomenal job emulating John Williams. Overall, the next freelancer artists to tackle a Star Wars film need to take risks. If Rogue One is the barometer for future installments however, there is little reason to be concerned."
9,"So we all new going into this movie what the end result was. What we didn't know was how this story progressed into episode 4. I can honestly say this movie was amazing, the effects, the nods to the original trilogy and the effort they made to make the look and feel of this film fit seamlessly with the original Star Wars film. It is a movie that stays with you long after you walk out the door. I am astounded that the critics have not recognised this film with much higher ratings overall. It most certainly deserves it. Deserving of a 'classic' rating and one for the collection. 9/10. Hard to find fault."
9,"'Rogue-one'. The movie which differs from all previous. The movie in which everything became serious. I already many times said to friends that I am not a fan of Star Wars. I had liked the seventh episode, but against the background of the Rogue it is some other... Children's most likely. In the Rogue there is almost everything: atmosphere (she here absolutely another), drama, light humour, very interesting characters and of course ACTION! As for a story, he simple and clear. The soundtrack is weak, but there is no wonder as one composer has left, and another has succeeded only in September. A visual part of the movie very beautiful, and a sound in an IMAX format just tremendous. Also in the movie the fan service is a lot of, fans will estimate. Offensively for me only one that the movie doesn't allow to reveal to characters, even to the main character. As for her, she is a fighting little girl who never gives up. Felicity Jones has played perfectly. And here the character Mad Mikkelsen is a father of the main character, but he catastrophically isn't enough. I don't know the others and there are nothing to tell about them, but their characters interesting. Well and the most abrupt moment of fans expects in the picture final. Result: I very strongly had liked this picture. She differs from all that is in this Universe and it does well her. Someone from fans will abuse her for gravity, someone will shout that there are no Jedis and the picture a priori becomes a hogwash, someone will shout about all our favourite canon, someone will hate for something else, and someone will just enjoy the events in this picture. And I grant a camp the fan of this picture. It is clear that Disney put the franchise on the conveyor, but the main thing that there was a quality. And in the Rogue it is."
9,"Genuinely perplexed by the negative reviews because this is a well-cast, expertly designed, well performed film that also happens to have been stylishly directed and cleverly written.  Its actually so well directed and performed that on the few occasions its script hits a bump, the momentum of its performances plus direction rolls right over them. No, it doesn't drip with easy charm and charism of Force Awakens but then again, it shouldn't.  [Mild Spoiler!] You couldnt watch this story unfold onto Ridley and Boyega. It's the Guns of Navarone of Star Wars films in the best possible ways."
9,"A truly fantastic movie, and the best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes back. The characters are all likable, the acting and music are great, the CGI is fantastic, and that ending... just wow! I would re-watch the ending a hundred times if I could.The only reasons it doesn't have a 10 are that we don't have many chances to sit down and really connect with the characters (what we do get is great, but a tiny bit more would be nice), and that several scenes in the trailers aren't actually in the movie (but this is understandable as Rogue One had to go through many re-shoots). Also, hopping from planet-to-planet at the start seemed a bit much, but it was needed for us to see all the characters.Overall, Rogue One is a truly exceptional movie, and I can't recommend it enough. Whether you're a Star Wars fanatic or not, it's still incredible."
9,"The movie has bit too quick of a start. You are jumping from one planet to another in span of few minutes and can get lost there. However, with second act of the movie this is gone and third one is probably best epic space fight we saw in Star Wars universe ever. The movie does a lot of fanservice, obvious to any SW fan, but which non-fans and first timers would probably didnt even notice (Hammerhead class ship from KoToR), however is funny, quick paced, the plot gets it together in second act and ties up really great at the end, the acting was very well done (especially Donnie Yen). Great movie, go watch, 6.5/10 average by 'professional' critics is absurd."
9,"Story/CharactersI thought that this film is very strong in it's story and characters.  Nothing is held back in this film.  The Rebels and Imperials are both fighting hard and dying while attempting to reach theirs goals.  The tone of this film is serious and thoughtful.  Each protagonist, while not given a great deal of screen time, has a distinct personality and worldview that is displayed through their conversations and behavior.  Visuals/MusicThe visual effects and music are, in my opinion, top notch.  While the visual style is different than previous Star Wars films, this is an intentional choice and it works for this film.  Action sequences are easy to follow (no excessive shaky cam or wild, rapid panning) and the cinematography and framing are excellent.  The sense of scale is impressive and CGI effect shots are mostly very well done.  If you're able to view this movie while keeping in mind that it is new and different in some ways, I think you'll enjoy it.  The music is not by John Williams, but it is clearly inspired by his work and it feels entirely appropriate for a Star Wars film.  In other words, this is the best that Star Wars music can be without simply reusing existing John Williams' existing material (which would have enjoyable but truly lacking in creativity).OverallThis may be my favorite Star Wars film and I say that as a fan of the series.  It is an adult-oriented film and could be called 'bittersweet'.  I found it powerful and emotionally moving while also still being fun and exciting.  If you find joy in watching epic space combat scenes as I do, this is a Star Wars film you'll particularly enjoy."
9,"This movie takes a long time to settle in, but a lot of that is due to the fact that so many new characters and worlds must be introduced. Once the movie settles in, it is non stop action. The third act rivals and 30 minute stretch in the Star Wars saga. This movie is darker than other Star Wars films and also provides a much murkier divide between good and evil."
9,"No, there's no lightsaber fight in this movie. But is the movie any good ? Yes, it is. It's what I call a perfect spin-off. Photography is astonishing, characters are good enough, battles and landscapes on point.You can really feel Edwards put his on style in the movie.So no, this isn't a masterpiece, but it's indeed a great movie and that's what I expected from it."
9,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is that movie which takes even a casual viewer, who has at least viewed the cinematic flicks, deep down into the Star Wars history/mythology. Seeing Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia brought back to the screen, as we first saw them in A New Hope, is such a feast for the eyes."
9,"The best stars wars since 1983, I was realy scared after the force awakens, because lets be honnest it was more like a remake of the first movie from the 70's, But this one has a original scenario and have a great story, the fact that there is no happy ending at the end make it better the movie is all about sacrifice.it's realy make the perfect conection with the 'new hope' plot great movie great star wars thanks god after the force awakens"
9,"Is movie fits perfectly into the Star Wars film line. Being a prequel to A New Hope, it had a lot to live up too, the film did not disappoint. The action and CGI were amazing. The only problem I had with the movie is that some of the characters were not as memorable as The Force Awakens. But all the other pros make any cons seem like nothing."
9,"
One of the best star wars movies out there. Definitely has by far the best star wars battle of all the movies. Much better than the force awakens. Will buy on blu ray or any special edition version.
"
9,"This is a much darker movie than any of the other Star Wars movies.  I found The Force Awakens to be slightly better than this one but I think that's only because I was so happy to see someone finally make a movie that lives up to the Star Wars name (I, II & III were horrible).  Plus, the nostalgia factor of seeing beloved characters again.  But I'll say this about Rouge One: the final 1/3 of the movie is as good...actually, better than, anything that any of the originals had done.  The first and second act had enough to keep me interested, but after watching the last act, looking back now, it pales in comparison.  Which is not to say I didn't thoroughly enjoy every bit of the movie.  They don't go into great depth with the new characters, but just enough so that you have an understanding of who they are and that you will care for them and their fate.  I liked all the references and throwbacks to the originals of course.  And Darth Vader's second appearance was just simply bad ass.  The one issue I had was the score.  And I'm not blaming the composer, I'm sure he did a great job.  I can't even say I'm that big a fan of John Williams, but after seeing 7 movies with his music, it kind of became a distraction when I heard it in the background..  All in all, if you are a fan of the originals you'll be a fan of this as well."
9,"I had low expectations after the cash-grab disappointment that was The Force Awakens, but Rogue One was a very pleasant surprise.Jyn Erso was wonderful, a true hero.Rogue One proves you dont need much lightsaber action at all to make a standout Star Wars movie.The most impressive thing about this film was how real it made the war feel. We saw sacrifices being made over and over for the sake of the Rebellion. This is why people are calling this a dark movie. Its too optimistic, the rebels too successful, for the movie to be called dark; its weighty. The successes are earned at incredible cost. Such is war.One notable disappointment here was the musical score. It felt largely repurposed from John Williams previous work and sometimes, that was enough, but it felt like a timid mimicry of greatness. Were there any new musical themes introduced? I dont recall any. Its fine, even necessary, to use the Imperial March when Vader shows up, but there needs to be more, too.We met so many delightful characters all human except for K-2, whose brand of humor was most welcome, and which stands in stark contrast to the dumb dad-jokes C-3PO made in the latter prequels. No, this was smarter humor, which felt (again) more earned.Heres hoping future Star Wars films will be more Rogue One and less The Force Awakens!"
9,"Tied with my 2nd favorite star wars film (a new hope). Empire strikes back is still my fav. Anyway, this movie is nearly flawless, but most its cast is forgettable/serviceable. The only two stand-out performances were a robot and Chirrut Imwe (as portrayed by the fantastic Donnie Yen). Definitely a great movie."
9,"This was an exhilarating and emotional roller coaster - not 'fun' as such,  and some of the characterisation is sketchy. However it has a surprisingly authentic war film vibe and is seemingly uncompromising by concerns of 'Disneyfication' - some of this is bold and brutal, especially the third act. This gives me hope for future standalone instalments."
9,"Star Wars: Rogue One Google ImageRogue One is everything you would expect from the 8th instalment of the Star Wars saga.We have incredible CGI and special effects that make this epic film larger than life. Fast paced space and ground battles with all the necessary trimmings and space troopers galore. Not to mention the funny android with an attitude problem and more personality than most humans. It is all there.The music score is very much in line with the series, yet still unique in its own way. This only adds to the overall feeling and knowledge that this is a self contained movie.The opening of Rogue One departs from the big score and introduction scrolling across the screen. I found this part a tiny bit disappointing - it is kind of a Star Wars thing after all. Even I know that, and admittedly I don't know much.The StorySet between Episode III and IV Rogue One tells the story of a band of rebels who are trying to get the plans for the Death Star. They are lead by Jyn Erso, who is the daughter of Galen Erso, the man who reluctantly developed the machine.During the construction Galen had secretly built in a weak spot at the core, hoping that the rebellion would be able to destroy the deadly weapon before the Empire had a chance to use it.His wish did not exactly come true, because the evil Orson Krennic uses it to destroy Jedha City in order to show its power to the Empirial Senat. This makes the task at hand all the more urgent and the rebels are prepared to sacrifice everything to complete their mission.The final showdown happens on the planet Scarif where the plans are stored. Star Wars fans who have been with the franchise for a whilewill probably know or at least guess the outcome of the movie. In my opinion that does not take anything away from the glory of watching it all happen in such a spectacular fashion on the big screen in 3D.Sequel yes / no?Rogue One is a stand alone movie but rumours continue to linger that there may be works in the pipeline to continue the story. I guess only time will tell. It is a very profitable franchise after all, so nothing is really unthinkable.Disney revamped the Star Wars tale with The Force Awakens in 2015. They are currently working to get the chapter of that out in 2017. If the trend continues then the next movies after that is not due until 2019, which leaves the perfect open spot in 2018 for something else. But that is just speculation on my part.Final thoughtsI have never been a Star Wars fan. To tell the truth the first movie in the franchise I ever saw was Episode I, and that only partly. I watched it years ago and the only part I remembered is the pod race. The first Star Wars movie I consciously watched was indeed The Force Awakens last year. After watching Rogue One now I am determined to make a marathon session over Christmas out of watching the entire series in one go. I will be off work for a few days, so that will give me the perfect opportunity to do that.There are two reasons for that. First is my newfound appreciation for the story. And secondly there is the knowledge that I am missing the overall picture. I can't really place any of the events around those two movies within the timeframe of the entire story. As I am certain, that there will be more films coming and I am also certain that I am going to watch them, I want to be able to see the whole picture when I do that."
9,"I don't get how the critic consensus only gives this film 65%. IMO, this is the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy. It ties into Episode IV perfectly, everything makes sense (for once) and the film even goes as far as to explain one of the biggest plot holes of A New Hope.In some ways, I even like Rogue One more than any other Star Wars film. For the first time, it's not a black vs. white fairytale, where the Rebellion is good and the Empire is bad (simply because the audience is told so). The characters in this film are more complex and nuanced than in any other SW film before. This is the modern re-boot of the amazing franchise we've all been waiting for.The only thing missing is the iconic Star Wars sound track. I don't know why they didn't use some of the original musical themes but if they had, I would give this film a perfect 10."
9,"I liked this movie.Yes, it was 'Star Wars,' with the series' expected pros and cons. And, likewise, 'Rogue One' was a *movie,* with the expected cliches and embellishments. That said, however, this 'Star Wars' movie was, in my opinion, a pleasing one, both in terms of entertainment value and as an interesting, satisfying story.Though, for me the movie's true appeal was in the wisdom that lay beneath the theater and images. That is, I felt that there was some *truth* written between the film's lines, of a rare, quality kind that carries over into the real world. For that reason, 'Rogue One' is, I believe, a 'good' movie.I don't see many film, literally just one a year (if that). As it were, 'Rogue One' was the one I saw this year, and I don't regret it.My sincere thanks goes out to all who worked to produce this movie. I am grateful for, and have benefited from, your time and service. Keep it up!"

Personally I thought that Rogue One was the best of all the modern Star Wars films. After watching this you will definitely want to watch A New Hope again.
"
9,"The last act was the best piece of Star Wars I've ever watched. I enjoyed act 1 and 2 but the characters become great at the last 45 min. The chemistry between Jyn and Cassian was good but in that point was The Force Awakens a lot better. All in all is Rogue One a great movie with incredible shots, a brutal and dark atmosphere. Episode VII was a movie for children, Rogue One is a phanomenal piece of Star Wars for the one's, who are adults but in their heart still children."
9,"I overall liked the movie. It is a 'Star Wars Story' but it apparently became something like the normal one, as I have seen at the end. I still didn't like how they freaking killed EVERYONE at the end, and there were slightly too many fighting scenes. But overall, I'll give it a 9."
9,"I actually really enjoyed this movie, and that is coming from a person that is not much of a Star Wars fan. It's also coming from a person that thinks The Force Awakens is one of the most overrated flicks of all time.My favorite parts of this movie was basically anything with CGI Tarkin and another character that is recreated with CGI (no spoilers (: ) and the entire final sequence of stealing the Death Star plans.You know what? I'm going to spoil it. They steal the Death Star plans and give them to Princess Leia. She gives them to the rebels and they destroy the Death Star! There, I just spoiled everything for you! LOL"
8,"Better from Force Awakens in my opinion and the plot is far from childish (there are no Jar Jar Binks or Ewoks or stupid kiddie stuff) this movie is way darker and dramatic and very close to 'The Empire Strikes back' atmosphere. Characters are more realistic in Rogue One with their ups and downs as opposed to Force Awakens which the main protagonist there appeared as a Super-Jedi feminist that knows everything without training..."
8,"Rogue One is thankfully another admirable Hollywood film that sincerely honors sacrifice, persistence, and hope. Of the Star Wars films, it's probably the best since the original three, and it links fairly well to the first.It would be nice to know more about some of the characters, to sense even more deeply what they've suffered, but the film's focus on the story of the ensemble and how it miraculously comes together leads to another fascinating point: Arguably its handling of the idea of the Force or of a force behind the force may be more suggestive of a beneficent divine Providence, and thus closer to the Judeo-Christian God, than in the original three films which seemed to say that the Force requires balance--the light side requires a dark side, and so on (e.g. any victory of the good side is always only temporary, to be followed by the ascendancy of the dark side due to the purported balanced nature of the Force). The new film's seeming shift is a positive development. That notion of balance, of equal eternal opposition of good and evil, failed (even in the fictional world) to adequately or helpfully distinguish between good and evil so as to recognize good as higher than or better than or transcendent over evil. One could even argue from this development that the original films involved untrustworthy narration that is only now being revealed. Perhaps full investment in the themes stated above required this development. Hope would be unfounded without it.And in its more unmitigated sense of a beneficent divine Providence watching over, superintending events, it feels reminiscent of the divine Providence and Creator (Eru Iluvitar) behind the scenes in The Lord of the Rings. But I guess time will tell if Star Wars really moves in this direction."
8,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie since 1980. The general consensus of last years Force Awakens was that the spirit of the original trilogy returned. However, the problem with Episode VII is in how the spirit is captured identically. In having returned so reverently, the franchise needed to display a willingness to tinker. Enter the newest cinematic addition to Star Wars. Rogue One is a balanced movie of hope and despair. The last Star Wars movie to find this magical balance in tone is The Empire Strikes Back. Likewise, Rogue One finds a unique synergy between old and new. The first anthology Star Wars movie works in its inevitable lead-in to an almost forty-year-old classic with a sense of invigoration. The movie smartly covers up modern filmmaking conventions with amazing throwbacks to the original trilogy. Seventies style facial hair can still be found on the Rebel pilots while a few smart cameos make the Star Wars initiated feel at home. The amount of Star Warsness to the film allows director Gareth Edwards to comfortably recton A New Hope. A problem with Rogue One is how the film can only be best enjoyed by a Star Wars fan. Rogue One is a decent enough war movie. The dogfights are exciting. The characters are charming and funny enough. The overall plot cant be fully enjoyed without having seen A New Hope. In addition, the cinematic impact the film has on the future of this storied franchise also can't be appreciated by an outsider. Rogue One features the most diverse cast of any Star Wars movie... as well as the franchises more intense scenes. The mentioned scenes make up some of the best moments in a Star Wars movie to date. Rest assured the future of the franchise is in the very capable hands of Disney. Rouge One is how a franchise should make the old relevant."
8,"The only reason I'm not giving Rogue One a 10/10 score is because it does have a some minor flaws in the plot and could have done a better job with character building. Overall however, this film is awesome, and I haven't enjoyed a Star Wars film so much since The Empire Strikes Back. It might even be the best overall. I certainly enjoyed it more than the Force Awakens."
8,"Good movie. I enjoyed it much more than the Force Awakens, which felt like a rehash of A New Hope. Finally we get a fresh Star Wars movie that makes use of the best elements of the SW universe while also giving us new things to discover and enjoy. I enjoyed the ensemble cast, and as usual the visual effects and battle scenes are top notch. Some of the dialogue was too exposition heavy though, and the cutting to so many different locations got confusing. Overall though, solid movie, and a good direction for the SW movies to be moving in."
8,"Rougue One is a human story about the many troopers who tried to do what was necessary to bring down the imperable alliance. It is a tale of loss, grief, sorrow and, of course, hope. Whilst not having the most fleshed out characters the film portrays and expands on the star wars mythos giving much more insight into this expansive universe. I adored the film. The film adds so much more depth to the original Star Wars film. It truly is a star wars story that feels freash. I can't wait for what is to come from this franchise and edally anticipate episode 8."
8,"Star Wars is in a strange place. The prequel trilogy are objectively worse movies than the original trilogy. But they do feel cut from the same cloth. The Force Awakens and Rogue One are better movies than the prequels, but feel cut from a different cloth. I found Rogue One to be a thoroughly enjoyable flick. The plot made sense and didn't step on the original films. I liked the diverse imperial bases. The film has minor flaws, such as some of the acting talent being wasted. Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen can do more/better! It seemed like K2SO got all the good comedic lines. Also a couple of times (minor spoiler) a character appears where the original actor has aged substantially or passed on. The approach taken to that seemed a little uncanny valley to me. Ultimately though the film lacks much of an underlying theme. Which makes it a flick, even though its a good one. Finally RIP Carrie Fisher."
8,"Rogue One kicks off the Star Wars spin-offs in great fashion. While it lacks compelling characters, it makes up for it with exhilarating action, spectacular visuals, great performances from it's cast and a third act that is none stop edge of your seat excitement and intensity. It also leads into 'A New Hope' perfectly without feeling forced. This is a Star Wars Story worth telling and worth experiencing on the big screen!"
8,"
A beautiful looking movie, proving that a stand alone movie set in this universe can succeed and do it with style. Its action packed leaving me wanting more.
"
8,"I was close to giving Rogue One a 10, but I am a tough grader and there were a few things that distracted me from giving it that high a rating. This is the Star Wars movie I have been waiting for since the original trilogy. Episode VII did not deliver the same feel that Rogue One does. This 'feels' and looks like Star Wars. Some of the recreations of settings from Ep. IV are very well done. The quibbles I have are few and mostly technical, not story or script related."
8,"This film is so much fun even with its few flaws.  My favorite part of the film is the third act which is terrifically shot with a lot of emotion and great action.  The lead up, the setting up of the team is put together fairly fast which doesn't allow for much character development.  Also I felt some of the cameos were forced just to get a fan reaction instead of writing them in with more thought.  Overall this is my fifth favorite Star Wars film behind the original trilogy and TFA. A-"
8,"Non-spoiler here.  I have to say it was well done.  Definitely a feel for the era it is set in.  The plot is solid and there are MANY nods to everything in the Star Wars Universe.  Sometimes you just have to listen to the background sounds and announcements.  I love the whole way everything unfolded all the way up until the end.  Then, in the last seconds, they drop a plot hole.  Not a plot hole for the movie, but where it fits into the universe of Star Wars.  Doesn't mean that the movie up until that point was bad.  I give credit where credit is due.  It just did a small bit of overreach in those last seconds.  This movie hits on all the points that it should.  It is one of the better movies to come from this universe.  It has a hard, war edge that I see spawned the comment that it is the first movie to acknowledge that there is a war going on.  While not totally accurate, the sentiment is.  It is no Empire, but it certainly hits a bit better than the Force Awakens.By the way, a lot of the scenes that ended up in the commercials are not in the movie.  I don't know which is the reshoot and not, but there is a ton of scenes in those commercials that are not in the movie.  This actually makes me hope for a definitive/director's cut that will be as additive as Batman v Superman.  This movie needed to be just a bit longer to properly provide exposition."
8,"This is rebellion on a whole new (epic) level. It's a fun and more grittier adventure to the galaxy far, far away.Rogue One; like all the SW-premieres are always a fun event to experience. Fans and non-fans alike collectively get together once again for this space adventure. It's visually a big upgrade from the prequels, and it does to a certain point manage to embrace the original film's charisma. Fun, bright and enjoyable characters is a big trace -- and forget romance! This is a pure war film where companionship is everything. We follow 'Jyn Erso' and the main story is greatly focused on her, but a major letdown is the underdeveloped side-characters. They are all well presented and we get some inside to their personalities; but there's no major background nor development to characters like 'Cassian Andor'. Our main antagonist 'Orson Krennic' is very much the same. But there are some deeper layers to him, but sadly not enough to be considered a complex nor memorable villain. Because of this lack of greater depth to characters; the few emotional moments that does exist could have been even greater, because there are some great ones. The great one-liners from K-2SO is on the other hand very much appreciated, it's great that they really understand the importance of humor in the SW universe.The story that takes place is full of action, as expected -- but more importantly; the characters are the major players here. A great character-filled first act, a more passive & calmer second act, to a stunning and perhaps too massive third act -- that's Rogue One. There're many characters and places involved in this story. All of this made some of the story uneven. It kept going, from places to places, characters to characters and so on; it became an experience that's a bit too far- stretched. It lost that 'wow-factor'. The second act takes a step back and didn't impress me on a personal level. It's okay but nothing really impressive got to me. But I am confident enough to say to all the big SW-fans out there that you will definitely love this film, and yes there are some really impressive action pieces -- but I never got many 'wow moments'. It drags on and lacks a greater long-term stamina when it comes to action. When looking at the CGI; it's a major technological achievement, except for two major CGI characters that look all other than alive. They are impressive to look at; much details, but the way they interact and talk is so fake. Add a non- Williams score that's underwhelming, well the flick got flaws. But other than that I really enjoyed it!It's a good Star Wars movie. Not the best nor the worst. It got its flaws concerning the uneven storytelling and undeveloped side-characters, and some flaws are more serious than other. It's a beautiful story that's partially gritty and it got a stunning visualization of Vader. Add a darker tone, a very satisfying finale and an ending that manages to wrap everything together! That's Rogue One. It's the pure definition of rebellion.*psst don't enter this film expecting much Vader.Personal rating: 82/100 Critical rating: 70/100"
8,"Overall incredible. Far better than the other prequels. I liked the storyline better than the Force Awakens, which had some strange plot holes it's hard to get past. On repeat viewings, I'll be able to decide whether I like this or Force Awakens better. The third act is legendary. Strengths: the story, the feel, the acting, the writing. Weaknesses: a few spots of jarring editing, music, and CGI."
8,"I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't actually motivated to see it, i found The Force Awakens to be throughly dull, but i had some time to kill and decided to go for it. Im so glad I did. The movie has some incredible visual moments, backed by incredible action, and a likeable (if underdeveloped) cast. The music isn't up to the standards of the series, and some characters are somewhat underused, but overall this is a throughly enjoyable film that eleven both Star Wars fans and none can enjoy. (although star wars fans will get more enjoyment out of the multitude of OT references that are present)."
8,"Rogue One isnt perfect, but it is a great breath of fresh air for the Star Wars Franchise. The direction feels very different at first, feeling more handheld at not super Star Wars-esque because of its grittier more grounded style, but this is great and works for the film. It ends up making it feel like a real war and struggle for the rebellion and it ends up changing later towards the end in tonal shift and direction to blend into A New Hope.Pacing is a little odd at first, but the first section is interesting enough to keep you very invested, especially with all the character introductions. The second act is a littler quieter and a bit of a lull but still has enough going on and differs itself from the rest of the film to keep it fresh. The last section is an intense all out action masterpiece, and really gives a space feeling of something similar to the end battle of Saving Private Ryan. Characters are well enough written for you to enjoy and like them all, however they are a little underdeveloped for the most part and you end up wanting more from them. This ends up not hindering the film too much since the film is a standalone. This film does carry itself well, it knows when to be dark without over doing it and changes location at a nice rate with a clear understanding of where and what folk are doing.This also the first film where Darth Vader is actually fully terrifying, he is almost like an insanely powerful sci fi MikeMyers. Even thoug he isnt in it much, his presence is palpable.The good thing about Rogue One also is that it doesnt try to keep using nostalgia to interest its viewers (which TFA did a lot) but does have plenty of nice little easter eggs.The droid K2SO in the film is also the comic relief of it, but whilst a few jokes hit the mark a lot are unnecessary and too forced in, and there is (like TFA) a lot of cheesy 2016 throwaway jokes just put in there. Disney need to learn to restrain themselves from certain jokes, and when they do put them in they need to understand when to end the joke and how to fully have them come across.Last two complaints, the new score for the film is cheesy and doesnt fit the film at all, and really takes away from it as a whole sadly. Dubbing John Williams over it would be very cheap, but to be honest it would probably make the film feel more epic and fit more. There is also some questionable CGI characters in the film which just look unnatural in the film but still dont ruin it too much.Overall, this film diverges enough away from Star Wars to make it feel fresh but also very nicely connects itself to the original trilogy. Action is awesome yet characters are a little underdeveloped, special effects are gorgeous but score is disappointing. It is a tragic war film set in the Star Wars universe, and Gareth Edwards did something brave with what he had.Bravo to you sir.8/10"
8,"The first time I watched the trailer, I was like meh. After watching the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. While I feel like this is not the most epic Star Wars movie ever (I mostly like lightsaber fights when it comes to Star Wars, and Rogue One does not have lightsaber fights), it's certainly decent. It's a classic father-daughter story, where you come to care about the characters. The robot droid was hysterical, honestly. Also, the tribute to characters such as Grand Moff Tarkin, was believable and plain creepy that they brought an actor who's been dead since the 90's, back to life. It was a pretty fantastic movie, much better than Force Awakens."

it was okay. lot of slow parts. far between fighting parts in the movie. but i did enjoy it. does tell us how they got the death star plans etc.  did not learn much about the main people in the movie at all very little.

8,"Related media: The three prequels have been quite soulless, as the actors had to act opposite green screens most of the time, while The Force Awakens (TFA) was a great disappointment as it heavily ripped off A New Hope (ANH). Check out my review of the latter, if you can find it.>What's Rogue One (RO) like?: Story-wise, it's like other past films where the protagonists had to risk their lives to infiltrate the opposite side so as to steal something, except that here, there are also spaceships and lasers... It was better than TFA, but it also has several problems. >Pros: >1. TFA broke many of the conventions and principles behind how The Force works and how things work in general! For no apparent reason, Rey knew how to pilot a complex spaceship and how to fight with a lightsaber without having been trained on either task beforehand. (This is all down to JJ Abrams. On Star Trek (2009) it was inspiring, but Into Darkness and TFA just made me question his destructive creativity. His earlier films were also quite unruly. I've decided to never watch his films again.)  RO avoids this by not invoking the use of the force that often. Most events made sense. This film is a fitting addition to the Star Wars Expanded Universe.>2. The battle scene on Scarif was nice. >Cons:>1. RO is only slightly better than TFA. The story is less contrived than in TFA. However, it was still rather ridiculous that our heroes need to travel to so many places and to go through so many hoops to get the jobs done. Some parts seemed drawn out. >2. Apart from Jyn, the other main characters were not developed sufficiently, in the rush to show the action scenes. >3. The actor playing Commander Krennic seemed to be over-acting, all the time. He was unnecessarily angry and devilish all of the time.>4. The CGI in this film has some significant flaws. The Star Destroyers look like Lego pieces when in front of a bright background, while the fully computer-generated Grand Moff Tarkin looked... computer-generated. The eyes! You have to sort out the problem with the static eyes!  The production had $200m and these problems were not solved?>5. I thought the destruction of Alderaan in ANH was the first time the Death Star fired its main laser and destroyed a planet? In ANH, Grand Moff Tarkin said, Princess Leia, before your execution, Id like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that is to be destroyed FIRST. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan. Furthermore, Obi-Wan only felt the pain from the destruction of Alderaan and not from any moon or planet before that. The firing of the main laser in RO was not mere a test. Has this film created a continuity error? >6. The new musical score was a strange and horrible choice. The score rises to a crescendo in a haphazard way and then abruptly drops and goes all over the place. Which inexperienced composer was hired to do this? A Golden Raspberry Award is coming up.> 7. There was no need to show Leia at the end of RO. (It is not a spoiler that she's coming up next in ANH.) The CGI was inadequate and the scene should have been left out.>How would the different age groups rate it?Children: ExcellentTeenagers: ExcellentYoung adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: Average.My rating: 4/5 (no half scores). It's worth it pay to watch it in the cinemas."

It is a good movie, but by no means a great one, or better than episode VII, it does what it pointed to do. The only thing i really hated was the CG characters... They just looked fake.

8,"'Star Wars: Rogue One' was an exciting film, the story was well created, the script was very good, but maybe it was not better than episode 7, I felt identified with the protagonists, the cameos are impresive, and without Doubt was one of my favorites of the saga."
8,"Black Hawk Down meets Star Wars, that is what it's like watching Rogue One and it truly delivers on the action. This has some of the absolute best action sequences in any Star Wars film and it actually has what many of the films have lacked, stakes. Through good characters and terrific acting, Rogue One manages to succeed what most prequels fail to do, enhance the impact of later films. I see myself watching A New Hope through a new point of view and I have to say, Gareth Edwards made a Star Wars movie that stands on its own. Yes it's not a perfect movie, but it's a really good movie with minor flaws."
8,"Rogue One is a great movie with a few drops here and there. The movie flows averagely pretty well for 2h15m, from an explanatory and choppy intro to one of the most breathtaking battles the Star Wars saga has ever seen and to what could be considered a true nerd-gasm in the final scenes. Lots of pleasant surprises, lots of welcome call-backs, maybe some lack of characters's depth. Non-fans will enjoy an alternative war movie; fans will thank Gareth Edwards for realizing their innest geeky dreams."
8,"Before you go directly to see this movie, ask yourself the following questions. Am I going to see at least one memorable Star Wars character in this film? Well, there isn't that many since this is supposed to be a spin-off. Am I going to experience the same feeling like the previous Star Wars films? Yes, and it's pretty unusual for a spin-off. Lastly, do these new characters make me want to see this movie? If you want to exactly know what happens to these characters, then yes. We can't tell you what happened to these characters for sure as that would lead to spoilers. Rogue One takes its main base and separates everything but left the feelings of the film just for the beneficial fans. It's not near a masterpiece, but at least it's trying to be something and that something is what Rogue One should be anyways."
8,"Good film. It adds to the previous films. And I believe it is the first time in a Star Wars film the Alliance does not consist of only heroes who won't do any wrong. Suddenly, the characters are not black and white and I think it is a really nice change."
8,"This is the first time I disagree with the critics, yes. Perhaps it's not charged with fresh faces nor a complete story for the whole franchise but this is pure gold. It has more action parts than any other since the Return Of The Jedi (1983), the chemistry is just fantastic and the plot is as well as those galaxy glory-days. This is a thing to behold. I literally (with the audience) almost cried with Rogue One's death, rebels ones and the beginning with A New Hope (1977) In my opinion it exceeds the second trilogy and it's immediately some of the best movies of 2016 (83%)"

Good film overall with some missteps. Acting, story, and action, were all tight. No problems there. The issues come up with cliched moments, a small lull in the second act, and an average ending.

8,"loved this movie! I really was invested in the characters, and even family that weren't familiar with star wars were craving more about what happens after. Of course I pointed to episode 4. The only thing that somewhat let me down was the amount of Vader screen time, however when he finally did show up you knew sh!t just got real and was fully satisfied."
8,"Rogue One presents several new (and good) things in the saga. Be it the rebel extremism of Saw Guerrera, a kind of religious belief (in Force itself), and even the dramatic deepening in the relationship father and daughter of Jyn and Galen Erso. All this with great action scenes and a beautiful soundtrack by Michael Giacchino. But notorious is the ability of director Gareth Edwards to balance all this and still show respect for the original trilogy, putting scenes with easter-eggs and wonderful references. Oh, and there's Darth Vader. Amazing"

The first half of the movie seemed a bit weirdly edited and all over the place, but the last act is amazing. Truly gives you a perspective of war that no other Star Wars movie has ever done. A great time at the cinema overall.
"
8,"(In-Depth) Rating - 8.2/10Rogue One, A Star Wars Story, tells the story of how the Rebellion captured the plans for the original Death Star. The film, which is filled to the brim with brilliant action and wonderful CGI, is a great film for fans and film-goers alike.Almost all of the performances in the film are well executed. The characters that these actors portray, however, are somewhat flat and lack emotional depth. Felicity Jones, who plays the character of Jyn Erso, is a wonderful addition to the many talents on screen. The character of Jyn Erso, however, is extremely weak and one-dimensional, considering that she is the main character of the film. Through flashbacks, we learn about her tragic past, and how her father was taken from her. You can't fully care about this character though, even with her backstory, and just resort to rooting for her simply because she is working with the rebellion. This happens with all of the other characters in the film as well.Michael Giacchino's score for Rogue One (which he composed in all of roughly 4 weeks, mind you) is the main reason why this film is good. It's magnificent blend between original score and pre-existing themes (most notably, Darth Vader's iconic theme) helps make the film slightly emotional, and truly shines during the action sequences, which are impressive even without the music.The CGI that encompasses Rogue One is arguably the best of the year. Everything from the glorious ground and space battles over Scarif to the endless amount of sets and and locations, the CGI blends almost perfectly with the live footage. However, arguably the most controversial aspect of Rogue One, is the inevitable inclusion of two motion-capture characters (no spoilers). Personally, I found these characters to be perfectly fine, minus a few (glaring) imperfections. All in all, Rogue One is not a perfect film (by any means), and definitely not as polished as last years' The Force Awakens. But the film is good (great, even), and will make for lots of fun and enjoyment."
8,"The first act has pacing problems, but once it gets going it's a great movie, especially the final act. I've seen it twice now and liked it more the second time, when you have a grasp of what's happening in the firs 45 minutes it's easier to enjoy.Those last 30 minutes are just perfection."

Star Wars Episode VII and JJ Abrams look very ridiculous in front of Rogue One, I've really enjoyed much more watching Rogue One than the non sense Ep VII
"
8,"'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' ultimately is black and white for me. As far as a final result and my reaction of the film as a whole, it was great entertainment and a lot of Star Wars fun. The action, once it started up, was fast-paced and constant. The effects were a, as expected, beautiful sight to see and also a lot of fun per usual. And lastly, the connection of this film to the Star Wars universe was very well done. So regardless of what I am about to say, Rogue One is definitely worth the view or two as it is a treat to see a new take, or at least, a more detailed take on events that happened within the Star Wars story line.Now for the bad: Even though it is entertaining, how bad can a Star Wars movie honestly be with all the previous ground work already laid out? This film was great when based off of the action, the Star Wars feel, and a story that is already so developed, it is easy to create something within it. Now what about performances? This film was great when no one was talking. The leads, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna, lacked charisma and presence while on screen. I felt no major connection to them nor did I feel I cared about them in the least bit. Easily, the more entertaining characters were within the performances of Alan Tudyk and Donnie Yen who played K-2SO and Chirrut mwe. These two held attention and were loved characters for the personality that they brought to the screen. Not to mention, I am saying that a robot brought more personality than two humans... That is an issue to me... So beyond the two very weak main characters, the early first half portion of the film starts out very slow. For what may be the first thirty minutes, it is frequent location jumps and story development with little enticing moments leading up to what begins the fast-paced action that easily makes the movie worthwhile. Just to put the slow-paced start in perspective, I watched this movie once at a 10:30 PM showing on pre-release night and fell asleep. Yes, it is that slow.So, regardless of my negativity, the Star Wars fan in me was extremely satisfied with what I was given. The overall Star Wars feel of these movies will more than likely forever give me a satisfied feel when I reach the end of it but as I stated before, Disney would have to try very hard to fail when they have a tried and true formula already laid out before them. They are going to need to make new characters that can deliver powerful performances if they wish to come back to the status that Star Wars was at when 'A New Hope' and the original trilogy first came out.-- Oberrated --"

8,"The first half of the movie worried me a little, mostly because of the unconvincing dialogues. The second half, however, was much better, I found the debate inside the rebellion and the war scenes well structured and realistic, and the ending was epic. What I did not appreciate was the choice to make in digital the characters whose original actors were either dead or too old to play the role: the result was a little disturbing, with grand Moff Tarkin reminding me awkwardly of Harry Potter's Dobby, I think they just should've changed actors... But that said, I overall enjoyed very much the movie."
8,"Rogue One delivers a newly established grit to the world of Star Wars, delivering the realism of war with stunning special effects. The story is solid in its idea and is straight to the point without being tangled in sub-plots, which also produces the negative that character development is lacking, ripping some of the emotional pull from the film, which is very much needed for a Star Wars film. The heroes throughout the film are each very unique, and whilst some get more screentime than others, they all play their part in the end, which really sets the tone of teamwork well. This film is a great action/adventure blockbuster that should not be missed, especially if youre a Star Wars fan; resulting in a good first entry to the Star Wars spinoffs. This film gets an 83% 8/10"

Forget what you see and knew of episodes 1-3. This one is the real prequel of SW episode of 1977; Jones and Luna moves and feels like fishes on water, and the doses of action will not dissapont the fanboys. One of best choices of current holidays.
"
8,"OK at first I almost walked out of the movie due to the fact that it was very slow paced but after the first 20 minutes or so it was fantastic fast as lightning and super fun full of adventure action and laughs was really glad with my choice to stay had a blast watching it a absolute must see for the holiday season good family choice as well"
8,"As a self-titled moderate Star Wars fan (I enjoy watching the movies, but am not an expert in Star Wars at all) I enjoyed the film. I think that this works as a stand alone film, that isn't going to change anyones life, but it is entertaining. As a member of the Star Wars family, it felt like a nice change of pace, was much grittier than usual, and had some good easter eggs. I say at the very least, this is a good movie to get you out of the house and get you a break from family during this holiday season."
8,"With only a few cheesy fan service moments and a long, exposition-filled first act, Rogue One makes up for nearly all mistakes with a beautiful final act and a thrilling final scene that kept me on the edge of my seat. If you are a Star Wars fan, this movie is a must see. If you're not, see it anyways."

Weak character development is overshadowed by an original plot with an amazing third act. First act of the movie is a choppy mess, but the rest of the film over delivers.

Rouge one has many great things about it. It has amazing action, funny humor, great special effects and CGI, and many great moments. The only problem the movie has is that while it has likable characters, they don't have much depth to them.

8,"Rogue One is a very well shot film. The CGI is without doubt some of the best I've ever seen. Seeing Vader again was awesome and not to mention Peter Cushing being brought back to life with flawless CGI.This film also  exceeded my expectations. It was original, well paced, well acted and overall a much grittier and realistic take on Star Wars.My Rating 8.6/10"
8,"Really enjoyed this addition to the Star Wars universe. It's a universe we're familiar with and a dark and gritty story that pays off in incredible ways at the end.  There are very few movies with 3rd acts that have left me with an almost immediate feeling that I needed or wanted more - and it pays off extremely well every time.The film expands the universe to a few new planets, but what I enjoyed most about these new locations is how real they feel.  They are bustling hubs, full of life and activity, a feeling that really captures how Mos Eisley felt the first time that I had seen it.  Most importantly though, the Empire is everywhere.  The scale of the Empire is shown off to massive degrees, and that's exactly the way it should be.  There is tremendous attention to details, and you can tell these worlds were crafted with great care in mind.The movie does seem to wear you down a bit before the 3rd act begins.  Many complaints show an issue with the movie being fairly boring or snoozy, or there being problems with the dialogue.  After seeing the film a couple of times, I don't think the movie snoozes as it does move from place to place briskly, but it does seem difficult for it to hold the audience's attention as we can see from other reviews.  Still, this is a movie about a desperate move by the Rebellion to find out more about the Empire's super weapon, and the tone is conveyed as such.  These characters are on a mission, and they have to do it quickly.  The stakes are high, and because they are so high, it is what helps the final parts of this move pay off in astounding ways.Still, the characters could have been rounded out just a touch more.  The acting is all really quite good, but there's just not enough of these characters to make us root for them a bit more.  It was what could have taken this film from really very good to excellent, but it's just not quite there.But everything pays off in the final act of this film.  It's a gigantic battle, and you can feel how desperate both sides are for victory.  These are some of the best moments in the entire saga's history - from the beginning of the battle to the final scene.  The Empire and Rebellion move like set pieces on a chess board - each strategically trying to turn the advantage, each coming up with a new surprise.  Of course, there is a moment here that every Star Wars fan could not help but love, but really, the entire battle is a classic moment for Star Wars.  The Battle at Scarif turns this movie from perhaps an average or dangerously below average to nearly astounding.  That is how good it is.  It pays off the journey to get to this point in the film, and while I didn't think it was a slog at all, I certainly appreciated the journey tremendously more so than the moments before it.  Indeed, the final moments left me wanting more, almost immediately, I wanted to go back.  It is can't miss stuff for any Star Wars Fan, and really, it makes the film pay off for any newcomer that might come into this universe as well.  It's exciting, it's poetic, it's fan service, but it's also very fresh.  Rogue One is not just a worthy addition to Star Wars - as a direct lead-in to A New Hope, it makes New Hope even more exciting in tremendous new ways.  Does it have a few problems? Sure it does, but Rogue One makes up for the issues in incredible ways, and it earns its spot as one of the top films in the entire series."
8,"Far from a perfect movie, Rogue One is an entertaining Sci-Fi action romp.  The Characters are all likable and relate-able though their introductions did seem a little rushed.    The biggest criticism I have is that at times it seemed that it wasn't sure what tone it wanted to have.  There are moments that are dark that hit a perfect tone for the dire story of the movie and then there are times where a heroic almost joyful fanfare plays (reminiscent of the OG Trilogy) and it just feels out of place with the scene.  One scene in particular was the biggest offender, When the Rebel Hammerhead cruiser sacrifices itself to take out one of the star destroyers and open the shield gate, the music is bouncy and has a twinkle to it...  NO, several dozen if not hundreds of Rebel sailors just sacrificed, willingly might I add, their lives to hopefully open the shield gate.  That needed to be somber or heroic.  And it was not.  There were a few other instances of this happening but not as dramatic as what I just wrote.  Other than the tonal issues at times, I feel the direction and acting in Rogue One was exemplary.  I feel it sets a good foundation for the 'offshoots' of the Star Wars franchise and I'm looking forward to what Lucasfilm and Disney have to offer down the road."

Well done movie with great special effects.Loved the character design. The costumes are awesome.Full of references of all the star wars universe.Recommended.
"
8,"Rogue One is a cinematically great, esp. the third part. But, it's still lacking the characterisations. Yet, the movie's still amazing. Hmm...the ending is a big twist. And, I don't know that 2 person in this movie are a CGI one. I don't know a lot about Star Wars Saga. But, I like this one, more than The Force Awakens."
8,"For the first time since the so unloved Prelogy, when I left the theater, I had that feeling, you know, that little feeling you have when you just saw a Star Wars Movie, I loved it, I really did, let me elaborate on this.1-The movie's purpose. I've always wondered how could a weapon as extraordinary as the death star have a flaw in it, and most importantly, how could the empire be unaware of it, Finally I have my answer.2-The Ironic Drama, following characters and getting attached to them knowing that they will die at the end of the movie, that is so cruel, so raw, and that makes the rebellion's values so much greater, those people went on a suicide mission, they fought, they killed, and they died for something they won't be able to experience, Freedom.3-The planets, we saw so many different environnement, so beautiful landscapes, so wonderful scenes, Visually, it was really beautiful, we experienced the diversity that defines Star Wars, the creativity that characterized Lucas'saga.4-Darth Vader, the first scene could be considered as rubbish fan-service, but the second one, had a purpose, directly link Rogue One to Ep IV, which makes it its direct prequel, that makes sense, plus THAT SCENE WAS MARVELOUS, when I saw Vader Killing those rebels, I had an orgasm.5-The Force as A religion, The Force is with me and I'm One With the force, replace Force by 'god', and you know what Chirrut is, A Badass Priest, He believed in the force when no one else did, the way he and Baze (which on the contrary was skeptical, but chose to believe when he saw his friend die) was really touching. 6-CGI, it was nearly perfect, Grand Moff Tarkin was, and he always will be (until ep IV ..), I loved the droid, really funny, and cynical.What I didn't like about the movie is the development of some the characters, Jyn, Andor and the relation between Galen and Krennicshould have been more developed, and I would have loved seeing General Akbar leading the fleet.Rogue One was a good movie, and a great Star Wars. and that makes Ep VII look even worse. Ep VII could have been much better if Disney didn't force JJ to do it before 2016.Anyway, May The Force Be With You!"
8,"This movie was a big surprise for me, being a series fan I went in without much expectations. I had this preconception made after watching the Force Awakens, which I found to be beautiful and very well made, but largely lacking in screenplay and plot. Rogue One is in my opinion funnier and more captivating than any of the prequels(1,2 and 3). The music and scenario are as as well done as always. Acting from the main characters could be the only lacking feature, but the movie makes up for it with the terrific screenplay and well orchestrated pace. Definitely recommend it."
8,"This film is for those who saw Episode IV in the theatres, only those who remember what they felt when they saw the stormtroopers, AT-AT, Star destroyers. they are the ones who really will enjoy this film, only a few will really feel chills to see certain characters. Only a few will return to 1977, for the others a good sci-fi movie could be considered."
7,"I enjoyed Rogue One despite its flaws.  The first half hour is somewhat complicated as you are trying to decipher who is who and what is going on.  Then you realize that most of the characters have the exact same personality and temperament.  I think there is supposed to be chemistry between the two leads (Jyn and Cassian) but since they both have the same personality it fails.  A new robot (K-2SO) is introduced to bring some MUCH needed humor into the movie, but not enough to compare to the original three movies made by Lucas in the 1970s.  It seems recent directors forget how much humor was in the original films, part of what makes them so special.  Also, the last two films are not very original.  There aren't many scenes that we haven't seen before in other Star Wars Films.  A good soundtrack should emphasize the mood of the scene - you should not be constantly aware of it.  What saves this film are the action sequences and spectacular CGI images.  The CGI of the two characters from the first trilogy are pretty amazing overall, but you can tell something is a little 'off'.  I also applaud the ending which is not the typical Hollywood happy ending. There is enough good in the film to satisfy the typical Star Wars fan until the next installment, but don't expect perfection."
7,"Rogue One does a lot of things right, but tallies up a few missteps along the way.The good:  Well-acted; great special effects that enhanced but did not distract; and solid action.The Bad:  Music added nothing to the story/was completely forgettable; plot was more complex than in needed to be.The Ugly:  ZERO emotional attachment to any character, good or bad.Should be a 6 but threw in an extra bone for the Vader action towards the end."
7,"Film was ok. Quite a lot of characters, shame they didn't get enough backstory for you to care about them before the end. Nice world war 2 battle scenes at the end. Main female character was 'meh'; first half of film she doesn't care and the second half she's making rousing speeches about hope. Great scene with Vader doing his evil thing on the rebel flagship at the very end. CGI Peter Cushing somewhat creepy, and probably not in the way that was intended. I am still waiting for the Star Wars film where the empire troops behave like the 'gene-built trained from birth to be natural killing machine super-soldiers' that they are supposed to be. But here we have another film where they flap comically about before lining up to be shot. I think the reprogrammed droid took out a platoon just on his own."
7,"Not a bad movie by any means but totally unnecessary. I felt the same way about the prequels even though this picture was executed much better than any of those. The Star Wars universe has a huge timeline (just look at the games etc.) yet they keep making movies that revolve around the same period."
7,"
Es una buena pelicula con el problema de que tira continuamente de fanservice para que el espectador, preferiblemente fan, no note lo mas mnimo las carencias de la pelcula.
"
7,"I will preface this by stating that I did not like TFA at all. I thought it was a complete retread of previous movies. I went into Rouge One with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the story is quite predictable, you can see almost all of the twists and turns coming from a mile away. The characters are ok, but not great. This is both a plus and a minus to the movie. Part of the reason I did not like TFA is that the characters were overly dominant to the movie. If you didn't like Finn or Rey the movie was hard to watch. None of the Rogue One characters stand out either way. No one really bothered me, but I also didn't care about any of them in any significant way. The movie is almost a paint by numbers remake of a half dozen WWII movies. I however liked this to a certain degree. I left thinking the movie did its job. It told a one off story that was engaging but not over the top. It gave me some space battles and ground fights that I could enjoy without setting up a series of other new movies (boo TFA)."
7,"Uneven. But the last half hour is a perfect 10. The acting is great all through the movie, though. The writing is the problem. There is far too little character development for one thing. Felicity Jones is the only character that gets any kind of development at all. There's more 'character' and quirkiness in any 10-minute segment of A New Hope than in this entire film. I don't understand filmmakers. They want action action action. But if we don't know these people we aren't going to care very much what happens to them. You are shocked and saddened if you see someone hit by a car, sure. But if someone you know, someone you care about, who has made you laugh, a friend, gets hit, you are really traumatized. That's why successful memorable stories let you get to know characters and to like them, so that when they live through dramatic events, it will hit you in the gut emotionally. If filmmakers don't take the trouble to do this, all the action in the world means nothing. I thought at one point of leaving this movie about an hour and ten minutes into it, because there's a real ho-hum stretch in the middle. But I was glad I didn't because the final half hour is one of the best final acts of any Star Wars movie, or any action film of any kind, at least it is up there with the best of the best. FYI I am totally ignoring that the movie is inconsistent with the opening scroll of ANH. These people aren't spies in any way shape or form. Unless you count as a spy because you steal an Imperial uniform for a few minutes. But whatever. Who cares. Go see it, but prepare yourself for a ride of very uneven quality."
7,"A step backward from The Force Awakens, the second Disney Star Wars film still retains many positive elements that continue to show why Star Wars is the only good blockbuster we have left. While this will end soon (after we get one a year for the next century), Rogue One keeps the good karma rolling with an entertaining and thoroughly well crafted epic space opera. Blending the action with story like few blockbusters care to do anymore, Rogue One has a sense of spectacle and wonder that these types of films should have, but few do. Beneath its CGI Peter Cushing is a beating heart that is infectious and permeates every scene in the film. Though it has its flaws, the film fulfills its goals of providing quality entertainment, but does not spare the audience in exposition and plot, nor does it compromise its serious moments with comedy. In other words, Rogue One is not like the soulless cash-ins we have seen this year such as Captain America: Civil War, Jason Bourne, The Magnificent Seven, or Doctor Strange. Instead, Rogue One has a sense of purpose and it is determined to fulfill this goal.The end result of Rogue One is simple: deliver the Death Star plans to CGI Princess Leia. I know it is the last scene, but it is not a spoiler in the least since that is literally the plot. Along the way, we meet Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and a bunch of other people including a surprise Mexican (as a half-Latino who saw this with 8 other family members, this caused a great amount of shock) and some other people. Jyn is the daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), who is working on the Death Star against his will as an engineer. After Galen sends a message out that informs the rebels as to the existence of the Death Star and how to defeat it, Jyn is brought in to help find Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). A criminal, Jyn was adopted by Saw after her mother was killed and her father kidnapped by the Empire. A rebel himself, Saw Gerrera is an extremist and rejected by the rebellion. Following this, the film continues to build up to Jyn and her band of misfits working towards delivering the plans to Princess Leia. Admittedly, the character development is really bad. I understand the argument that this a one-off film, but this is hardly an excuse. Everybody here - including Jyn - is disposable. That said, some of these characters are seriously great, especially Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen). A blind man who wishes he was a jedi, Chirrut is actively a believer in the force and depends upon it for survival on more than one occasion. Of all the new characters, Chirrut is the easiest to root for and emphasizes the connections that can be made between the force/jedis and religion. Whenever he is on the screen, the scene is guaranteed to be incredibly powerful. Yet, while the film lacks character development, it does a good job making them likable. At all turns, the characters are endearing and, as a result, it makes the ending incredibly powerful and momentous, rather than easy to forget.In terms of the acting, Rogue One is far better than anything the original trilogy offered. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford, were and are horrifically bad actors. Though they improved throughout the original trilogy (Hamill stayed the same or got worse though and age has not helped this; honestly, Hayden Christensen is better in the prequels than Hamill in any original trilogy film), the acting was always sub-par. Here, the actors are all up to the task. There are some awkward deliveries along the way from Diego Luna, but nothing to knock him down a peg. Otherwise, the rest of the cast brought their B+ game, which is acceptable for a film of this type. The only exception here is Forest Whitaker who was inexplicably bad. It sounded like each word had to escape from his mouth as he tried to keep it down. Just speak and not with some raspy voice that sounds fake.Plot-wise, there has been a lot of criticism towards the first two acts. Though incredibly slow and hardly as effective as the final act, the first two acts tie in so many prequel elements and original trilogy elements in order to tie them together beautifully, it cannot be ignored. Yes, a lot of it is fan service. However, the film needed to serve as a bridge between Episodes III and IV and it accomplishes this in the first two acts. Here, we see the terror on average families, learn about the Death Star, and are introduced to the rebellion, its indecisiveness, and issues it faces. Though slower than the huge finish, the first two acts are valuable and thoroughly engrossing all the same.That said though, the final act is impeccable. Building the film to a fever pitch, Gareth Edwards spills his toy box over with a truly fun ending. With Darth Vader exuding the terror he did in the original films and a powerful conclusion for the heroes of Rogue One, this film defines its unique status amongst modern blockbusters here in this final act."
7,"I really want to give this movie a higher score but I just can't. I'll list the good things about this movie first. This one in my opinion has the best space battles, visually stunning and action packed. It's more of a war film compared to the other star wars movies. Some of the new characters were pretty cool, their performances were actually good. Well acted, but not amazing. My biggest issue with the film would have to be character's backstory. I'm not going to count the female protagonist,because the movie did a good job explaining her past, but what about the other guys? Some of the good guys were put in without a backstory, so the entire time while I was watching the movie, I was wondering about their backgrounds. My second issue is the the second act, it felt a bit slow because the pacing. The third act was very good, well executed and definitely worth watching just for the third act in this film."
7,"With 'Rogue One,' Gareth Edwards has created an intriguing, gritty war film that somehow also manages to double as a companion piece to established 'Star Wars' lore. No small feat. The top notch production design and special effects also help lend an air of authenticity and effort to this undeniably well-produced mid-quel of sorts. I may wish that a bit more detail was given to certain characters, and that the plot was a little bit more clean in its opening acts, but I will gladly take this over a circa-90's/00's CGI slog of flagrant racial stereotypes and political drivel. Consider me entertained and then some!"
7,"As much as I wanted to love this movie, I just couldn't. Don't get me wrong, I don't find 'Rouge One' to be a bad movie by any means. It is simply a film that isn't without some flaws. Say what you want about 'The Force Awakens', but at least there was structure behind it. It had great dialogue, great editing, clear direction and well-rounded characters. With 'Rouge One' the dialogue is not always spot on, the editing is a bit jarring at times, there's not always clear direction and there is not a great sense of care of the characters. Some of the characters from Ben Mendelshon, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, and Donnie Yen were much more memorable than others. Even two particular old school Star Wars characters impressed the hell out of me. At the same time, I found the rest of the characters to be nowhere as interesting. The biggest problem with 'Rouge One' is that it doesn't take the time to flesh out our main protagonist's. When we get to bigger moments towards the end, there is no sense of worry or care about the fate of most of these new characters. But what ultimately makes this movie an enjoyable feast for the eyes is the action. The last thrid of this movie in particular is what everyone is going to be talking about. It absolutely looks stunning. Overall, has an interesting story, but it doesn't have as many interesting/memorable characters, or great structure in storytelling. Nevertheless, there is still enjoyment to behold. I'm going to give 'Rouge One: A Star Wars Story' a B!"
7,"This is a good movie, but not even nearly as good as The Force Awakens. It is quite the spectacle, and a reasonably coherent story, but somewhat lacking in character development. It is also definitively the darkest Star Wars movie, but that didn't really have much impact for me, perhaps do to the aforementioned lack of character development leading to a lack of caring about the stakes.All I'll say about the plot is that it is a wholly original take on Star Wars, but a few times seems quite hemmed in by how it has to end. I wonder if they originally meant for it to be different, but were forced to change things for the sake of continuity.The acting was mostly decent, but not great. I did think that Felicity Jones stood out in a good way in that department as Jyn Erso."
7,"I've waited to see a 5/10 movie, so i decided to count plusses and minuses.Main male character is -Main female character is +-Grand Moff Tarkin is +++Lack of normal Imperial March when Vader enters the room is -Blind monk with heavy friend is +Two boring inspirational speaks is --Three in time jokes is ++Couple of off time jokes is -The End is +New robot is - (except for final part +)7 total."
7,"Rogue One does a lot of things and does all of them well, but not well enough.The visuals here are off-the-chart good: the effects are unparalleled (practical Star Destroyers looked jaw-dropping), the photography is gorgeous and the production design is ace. Director Gareth Edwards large scale, space opera moments are truly wondrous, but his smaller scale scenes, particularly dialogue exchanges, falter. There's this uncomfortable sense that his in scene direction was precise and purposeful, but his handheld camera's coverage pretty much butchers every conversation into a messy blur of words in which the basic topical beats and decisions are given no weight whatsoever. It doesn't help that not a single character is fleshed out beyond a singular facet of personality and that no actual team banter occurs, but I quite often found myself unsure of what certain exchanges were even about or why they were needed.It's a shame, because the handheld camera looks SO great. I'm surprised that there wasn't more of a Children Of Men influence on the film. It would have been great to see civilians joining the fight so that each battlefield felt organic and truly like a galaxy at war. A greater focus on the intimate details of the Rebellion's guerrilla warfare style and teh suffering of the innocents while on Jedha could have nailed this. The score as well suffers from using the wrong theme tonally from the original trilogy to adapt. The score isn't bad, but its tonally incoherent with the film, as if Giachinno was told to make it more positive than Desplat's darker work. Building the score around a darker, lower-tempo version of William's 'Imperial March' like the second trailer did would have been far more effective. It's just never ominous or rousing enough.With all that being said, this film is a remarkable technical achievement and an enjoyable experience. Regardless of people's issues with The Force Awaken's and Rogue One, it's incredibly exciting to see Disney actually bringing real movie magic back to cinemas."

CG/special effects are marvelous. This interstitial Star Wars Saga is a perfect insert that adds dramatic guidance to the entire Stars Wars labyrinth. Other than the somewhat overwrought and at times confusing space battles, well done.

7,"Rogue One starts off with so many ideas/characters/plot and action that you wonder if it will all get resolved. It does and it becomes a wonderful introduction to the first Star Wars film, 'A New Hope'. The only real weakness here is the blatant overacting of the cast, which causes about half of them to be unlikeable."

Despite an uneven first act that sprawls with far too many characters and locations, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story recovers with gritty action, plenty of heart, and a thrilling third act that ties the story to A New Hope well.

If it wouldve had darth vader just kicking but, just destroying everything, showing off his amazing powers for like 10 minutes id have given it a 9 or 10."
7,"It was always going to have a predictable outcome, but a pretty decent flick nonetheless. Just good enough to stay in 'go watch it eventually' status.The beginning of the movie planet-hops a bit too much, some characters feel underdeveloped, and the action scenes could've been more interesting.Really fun third act though. Special mention for Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen, they did a great job playing their characters."
7,"Rogue One justifies the existence of 'anthology' films by showing that moviemakers will be largely free to step outside of the narrowly defined genre to create stories we never thought we'd see in the Star Wars universe. Rogue One isn't an adventure set during a civil war. It's a War Movie, and definitely not one that's suitable for younger fans. The director does a great job of making the war feel like the decades-long struggle it's supposed to be, and the actors are universally good to great in their roles. The script isn't as tight as it could be, but it's good enough."
7,"Does a lot of things right, and some crtical ones wrong. The biggest negatives 1) score and music editing (timing of music with whats happening on screen is completely offputting and doesnt help in setting the tone2) first half introductions and character motivations were eehhh.3) inspiration speeches from people we just met 4) cgi tarkin,(other character from new hope) and vaders voice.5) didnt' really care for the characters apart from the main trio (madds included).Positivesthe second half .. and the environmental/battle/ship graphics- wow. just wow. see this in imax if possible just for the visuals. also, the nice connection at the end to the new hope. all in all id have given this an 8.5 if it had been scored well . still, heaps better than VII"
7,"A good refreshment after the disaster called 'The Force Awakens.' The difference between this movie and the latter is the sole fact that this one doesn't rely on stealing plots. Gareth Edwards has had courage to include characters and openly mention the Clone Wars without being scared like some directors who are led to believe that the prequel trilogy is bad. All in all, this movie is great. 7/10"
7,"I do think, this prequel for the original movies is much better than the recent sequel. The story actually feels worth to tell, and that is something not a lot of prequels can offer. The action and the characters hold their ground for a 2 hours long movie, which (Spoiler) will have no direct sequel. But especially the end felt much to forced and kind of teinted the movie."
7,"Good story, explains stuff that people have been questioning since 1977, philosophical. Really, the worst part about this movie is the very last shot...CGI Princess Leia? Ugh..."
7,"Overall a good film. After the first scene the film jumps around a bit and does seem confusing but it gets better in the second half with a very strong ending. Obviously a must watch for Star Wars fans but even if you aren't it's still very entertaining."
7,"I thought it was a solid movie, 7/10. The pacing was a bit too fast in the beginning, then suddenly drags in the middle, but the third act really sells the show. This makes it hard to give it above a 7, but all in all the movie was a meaningful, unique story within the confines of the star wars universe that I enjoyed. In fact I'd say this movie was executed much better than Episode 7. TFA was heavy on the nostalgia pandering but left me guessing about WAY too much relevant plot information because they were saved for the books and future movies. Unlike TFA, I didn't HAVE to watch Clone Wars/Rebels or read the novelization to understand what was going on in Rogue One. It's cool for backstory but it didn't detract from the plot of the movie in front of me. The cast was amazing and although I didn't come to 'care' for all of the characters' fates because there were a lot of them, I believe they each contributed something to the mission and overall movie. They weren't just on screen cracking jokes while getting their butts handed to them (Finn). Donnie and the Droid were especially show stealers, but by far my favorite character has to be Krennic. I might just rewatch the movie just to see Darth Vader going nuts on those dudes in the corridor, ha. Lastly, I loved how they filmed the Death Star beautifully looming in the sky before vaporizing everything. The cinematography in those scenes was fantastic. Really emphasizes the psychological warfare of seeing the Death Star hanging out over your planet.Admittedly I was concerned about the quality of the stand alone Star Wars movies since I am quite upset with how TFA turned out, but if this is how things are going to look in the future, I may continue watching Disney's Star Wars."
7,"Rogue One could be dull for young viewers or unremeakable thanks to it's nothing-new-to-show story-telling, but its main classic characters slow but significant appearence during the film and its shocking moments, Roge One becomes form a simple plot to a cool film."
7,"In five years I will appreciate Rogue One more than I do today.This is the first Star Wars movie with a major departure from the formula that viewers have come to expect from the franchise and it is instantly noticeable.These major departures have both a positive and negative impact on the movie as a whole.Throughout the film you will find yourself comfortable in the world of Star Wars for a moment, then the movie will make it aware you are watching the creation of someone else with their own ideas.Watching this movie in the theater I felt conflicted as these new ideas were meddling with something that I have grown up with for years.However after a night to sleep on the matter, I came to the conclusion that some of my perceived flaws in the movie will become all too important in the coming years.Those who are a die hard Star Wars fan will notice this instantly.The opening of the movie is drastically different than what you would expect from anything in the Star Wars universe. It delves straight into a frantic affair rather than the slow crawl of subtext that appear throughout the series.There is a lack of screen wipes during scene changes, this might sound like a small detail, but in the grand scheme of Star Wars movies, this has always been a staple that felt extremely jarring for a first time viewing.Its these small details that dont feel familiar which will have people annoyed or at least scratching their heads.Also Darth Vader makes a pun. No, that should never happen again.That being said, I appreciate the movie nonetheless.This movie is not afraid to take risks and I greatly respect that.While the previous filming  decisions seem a bit jarring, many of the other changes to the Star Wars formula feel like a welcome addition to the universe.The Rebel Alliance is shown to be something other than an angelic being to rid the galaxy of the big bad guys.They make deals with extremists, fight guerrilla wars and hide within civilian populations. I love the expansion of ideals and it even warrants the idea that some were even content or happy with the empire in comparison.The agents and main characters arent necessarily the good guys, they are just fighting for what they believe in. Many of them even fight for what the viewer may perceive as the wrong reasons, but the right cause.There is so much in this movie that makes the conflict and galaxy feel more real than the main series.Especially the third act, which is hands down the best part of the movie.The final battle was magnificent from beginning to end, it felt like watching the Vietnam War in space. That is about the best thing I could ever imagine.I could have had the entire movie be the story be about some random soldiers on this battlefield and it might have actually been a better film.Unfortunately because of the highs of the third act it makes the first two acts look weak in comparison.The film has some major pacing issues in the first act. Nothing quite seemed to flow properly and getting all the information before the film moved along to the next scene was challenging.It feels like first portions of the movie were solely there to get towards the final act. That inherently makes it less fun to experience.The film needed a couple more relaxed moments for the characters to build who they were for each other.

They never quite felt like they cared for each other which in a movie about a squad of characters is really needed.

The best comparison I can make is to Guardians of The Galaxy. The characters never had that moment of interaction that made them bond together through exploits which Guardians of The Galaxy pulled off with flying colors.

This movie needed that to really put the exclamation point on the third act.

In summary, I enjoyed the hell out of Rogue One despite some pacing issues and lack of character empathy.

If you didnt enjoy The Force Awakens because it felt like a retread of the original film, this will likely be a much more enjoyable affair.

As a movie, it feels like a fresh take on the Star Wars universe. While that doesnt always work the way intended, it sets up the ability for other directors and filmmakers in the future to do the same. I greatly respect that idea and look forward to see what is next.

7,"Rogue One is an amazing movie, but it takes some time to become it. It has an uneven, and somewhat uninteresting beginning, a fun but rather incongruous middle, and a spectacular end. Along the way, it both suffers and benefits from the world in which it's set.Rogue One is a unique journey through a very familiar world. It has everything you'd hope to see in a Star Wars movie - space battles, stormtroopers, new alien races, lovable droids, rogues turned heroes. Yet it still manages to feel fresh and different from the rest. I personally felt that this was one of the film's strengths, that it was something different. However, the film also pays a little too much homage to Star Wars: A New Hope, its immediate successor in the Star Wars chronology. There are several character from the original film who appear in Rogue One, a couple of whom are digitally rendered. It doesn't work. At all. It's rather unsettling to look at, and I'd much prefer they just recast those roles if they're set on using those characters.Once the film builds momentum, it's delightful to watch. The humor is great, the action is thrilling, and there are some genuinely real character moments. Sadly, the film is also punctuated throughout with heavy-handed attempts to inspire (you've never heard the word 'hope' used so many times in a single screenplay). And there is an evil lair which is laughably on the nose. It couldn't get more stereotypically cartoonish.Despite its faults, Rogue One is a great time. It's definitely worth seeing in the theaters, but be aware: it might be a little intense for young kids."
7,"This movie wants to be a more serious character driven movie (for the first 1/2 to 2/3), but without any memorable characters except one sidekick with not enough screen time. Being a prequel also saps some of the potential drama. You know mostly how things will end up. The action at the end saves the movie, pushing it into watchable territory, but without the emotional payoff it was trying so hard to achieve. The only reason you care about any of it is because of the knowledge of the better movies that come after. Rogue One seems to accept this, and is liberally sprinkled with references to those movies as a substitute to fleshing out its own plot or characters."
7,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a fan-oriented movie, to my mind. I have watched all the movies, but I disliked this one because of many reaons. First, the story is very predictive, and it is not interesting at all. I know this is a spin-off, but still it is not worth. Second, sometimes it was so boring that I decided to sleep. Overall, I recommend watching this movie only if you are a true fan of Star Wars."
7,"This is a grittier, darker Star Wars film than the main saga. The battle's feel more real, gravitated and weighted. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning and deserves full marks. Some of the scenes in Rogue One are some of the best I've ever seen in a Star Wars film. The beginning of the movie however, is muddled and lacks focus. There are too many characters with not enough development, and too many things happening to really get your teeth into. While the second half of the film will blow audiences away, the first feels a little clunky and the re-shooting seems obvious as you watch.Although it has a shaky start, the film is definitely worth watching, especially for Star Wars fans. There is much to enjoy here but it comes with some flaws. If you forgive it for it's pacing and character misfires, this is a solid entry in the franchise."
7,"There was a lot this movie did right, mainly the humor and the action sequences. Laughter was frequent while watching this movie, and the action sequences were carefully constructed and perfectly executed, with the hits and punches all coming in heavy and every now and then making you call out 'Yes!' when one lands brutally. K-2 was the absolute definite highlight of the movie, with much of the humor coming from his dialogue. The scene with Darth Vader comes in at the very end, like last 2 minutes and only lasts as long. Some of the shots in the trailer from this scene were cut, but the scene is so badass and so intense, it easily becomes the best scene of the movie. The movie does not have an opening crawl, and that is for two reasons: 1) this is not part of any of the trilogies, and ends quite conclusively for the main characters, and 2) this movie is actually a visual portrayal of the events detailed in the opening crawl from A New Hope. Thus, giving an opening crawl to this movie would've been redundant. The story is pretty simple, only meant to bridge the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. Rogue One tells the tale of Jyn, her father who was forced to build the Death Star, his secret fault he built in the reactor, and the Rebellion attempting to get the plans for the Death Star in order to launch an attack on it. If you've seen Episode IV, then you'll know how this movie ends.Now, for what this movie does bad. And it does quite a lot, though surprisingly it doesn't really detract from the experience too much. First of all, the CGI characters, specifically Grand Tarkin and Young Princess Lea. Obviously they couldn't physically recast Peter Cushing, and Carrie Fisher aged almost 40 years. So the choice was made to use CGI character representations of them, and man was it bad. Not only did Tarkin move like a chimp from the new Planet of the Apes movies, but he had a very video game-like stilt to his movements, and his imagery looked like they tried to go hyper-realistic and overdid it. And his voice, every time Tarkin spoke, it pissed me off, because it sounds NOTHING like Peter Cushing or the way he sounded in Episode IV. Princess Lea looked really good on the other hand, but her animation was so stiff, they could've just used a post-added still frame of her from A New Hope and it would've looked about the same. The other thing this movie did badly, and this is what drops my score the most, is the character arcs and development. Cassian's arc starts out starts out kind of like a Han Solo rugged guy, then is revealed to be part of the Rebellion, then is made out to be a bad guy by getting and agreeing to follow orders that directly conflict with Jyn, then him not following the orders, to him becoming a true ally to Jyn, to becoming a love interest to her. His arc is so all over the place, it looks like they were just checking off character traits and found they were short a few for the movie, so they packed them all into him. For being the main character, Jyn hardly does anything, except for kill a few Storm Troopers on Jedah and help find where in the Archives the Death Star plans are. Saw Gerrera is played by Forest Whitaker, and is hyped up to be a badass warrior with a long war torn history, and yet is shown only for a couple minutes near the beginning and is immediately killed off. Baze and Chirrut were a fun duo, and besides K-2SO, these guys are the only other ones providing humor. The Defector Pilot also kinda does too, but besides these 4 characters, no one else is likeable.You definitely need to see this movie if you've seen the other Star Wars movies, and it is quite fun to watch, with good humor and solid action throughout, but a few big flaws detract this movie from being as good as it could've been."
7,"Rogue One was definitely a decent movie. Far better than the force awakens. There were some loopholes, but a big one was a main core of the rebellion followed someone who had absolutely no tactical experience, no war time experience, nothing. Not even a dash of experience at all really; and any of the people who followed Jyn could have easily filled the leader role. I just didn't understand that at all. Jyn assuming command realistically and practically makes no sense what-so-ever. Don't get me wrong. I honestly don't give a F about a bad @ss female leadership role, like Lieutenant Ripley(Alien+), Selene(Underworld), Kerry Mathison (Homeland), etc. Just do it right and I have no problem.Another issue was the rebel commander (the woman in all white, whoever she is). In the original Star Wars she was not in-charge. Princess/Senator Leia was and she was the inspiration that the rebels needed, not Jyn. Moreover, the plans for the Death Star were not transmitted, they were hand given to Leia and she hid them within R2D2.I can go on, but people just need to watch this for themselves. I do recommend watching Rogue One despite the issues I have listed, and did not list.Side note: I was ecstatic that there was no PC/SJW BS. Some of the screen writers were talking white supremacy so don't expect anything risible and moronic as that."
7,"It may be that the first part of the movie seems a little boring, simple but it improves every time the movie is progressing and also has one of the most epic battles ever seen in the star wars franchise. Is mandatory and recommended for star wars fans.It be imperfect and whit some mistakes but ends up being very good and entertaining movie . I give it 7.5 good"
7,"It was a story that did not need to told. If you watch episode four you know the rebellion got the plans at a great loss. The grafics that were used to to bring people from episode four back were terrible. The story line did show the dark side of the rebellion so I can respect that since there is always a dark side to any side of any war. ingrew up on this and credit the Star Wars movies to a part that made me want to be a soldier and to be apart of something greater then myself so to the rogue one story line thank you for showing that average people with great courage can accomplish great things."
7,"I'm a die-hard Star Wars fan. I had really high hopes for this movie, especially since I also really liked The Force Awakens, and to be honest, this was a good movie, but not as good as I expected. The first act of this movie really had problems with the pacing. I wanted to see more deeply into the characters, and see what their personalities were like. It would have been also cool if they had back stories too, but the characters just feel forced in to me, without much characterization of them, which is really sloppy pacing to me. However, the 2nd and 3rd acts were much better in my opinion. We got a great storyline that connects to A New Hope, and there were some amazing emotional scenes as well. I also gotta admit that K-2SO's jokes had me laughing. Where the movie really stands out to me however is the 3rd act. We got some amazing battles, both in the galaxy and on the beach too. It was nice seeing all these things from previous Star Wars movies come back. The graphics were really nice too. So yeah, overall, not my favorite Star Wars movie, but it was certainly not bad. It has flaws, especially in the first act with the pacing, but I can forgive that because of the great storyline that conflicts with the characters and how the storyline connects to a New Hope, the hilarious jokes and emotional heartbreaking scenes, and the extremely amazing battles in the 3rd act. So overall, I'd recommend this Star Wars movie. I'm giving it a B and a 7/10."
7,"This film is the first in the series of Star Wars Anthology films which arebasically side-stories which don't necessarily follow the plot of the main series (good vs evil). This movie does feel different to the main series but still keeps the Star Wars essence in there which was great as that was exactly what the movie was opting for and it was achieved well.The movie lives up to the title of 'Star Wars' quite literally unlike the other films; we see lots of galactic warfare not seen in any other Star Wars film before. The film is also shot with lots of handheld-cam which gives a 'warzone'-type feel to it which I liked.Other sides of the galaxy that aren't focused on in the main series are shown in this movie, showing other sides of the Empire and how they operate outside of destroying Rebels. It also shows how life is for regular people who aren't getting caught up in the war mess which helps to capture the feel of this being one big universe with many things going on inside it other than the story of the Skywalkers.Felicity Jones was good as the lead character Jyn Erso; her character was explored well and was good to root for. There were some members of the supporting cast that stood out, the droid K-2SO with its charisma and the force-sensitive guy too. However the others, while nice to have around, didn't really receive much development and felt quite one-dimensional at times. I also found many characters to be under-used like Forest Whitaker's character for example who I think should've played a bigger part in the story and was necessary for a lot more of it I believe.This movie blew me away visually; this has got to be one of the best-looking movies I have seen in a long time. It is absolutely outstanding to look at and I would happily have any image from this film as a screensaver or wallpaper. The CGI is also mind-blowing; there are a few characters who appeared in the original who were recreated with CGI in this film but it honestly looks amazing. You'll likely forget that the Special Edition ever existed.The thing I probably loved the most about this film was the final act and ending and how it all tied together with the rest of the trilogy. I won't go into spoilers but I just have to say it was absolutely great and there was no better way to end the film.I was quite disappointed by the lack of screen time from Darth Vader. If he hadn't been shown in the trailers and used as marketing then I probably would've been less annoyed by his short appearance but he could've easily been used in more of the story. However, he felt truly like his character in the scenes he was in and only said things his character would say and not rubbish like 'NOOO!!!!'. Let's just forget that line was ever spoken.The references to other Star Wars films were great and fit in very well and I couldn't stop myself from smiling multiple times. It just goes to show that this material is in the hands of people who understand how much these films mean to many.I personally prefer The Force Awakens over this movie because even though Force Awakens reused the plot of the original film, it brought many new things like great acting, well-developed characters, emotion and great environments. This film had an original plot but didn't do as well as Force Awakens did in terms of characters and emotion.Overall, this was a pretty decent movie with amazing visuals, a good lead character and also great references to other Star Wars films. My only issues were lack of character development for some of the supporting characters and that some of the characters were under-used in my opinion like Forest Whitaker's character and Darth Vader. This film has made me intrigued to see more of the anthology films and I hope they'll expand the universe more like this movie did.7.7/10"
7,"
The Star Wars backdrop make this movie far more interesting than the writing.  Ultimately this move is a C- at best but if you're a sci-fi/star wars fan it's almost a must see.  The droid dialogue alone is worth the view.
"
6,"It's a relatively fun movie, especially as a nostalgia fix if you liked the original three films (like I did), but one element REALLY annoyed me - the CGI-created faces of Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia. I mean, great attempt, and fun. But they simply don't look real!  I mean, if they could pull this sort of thing off in Avatar and hundreds of other 'animated' movies, why was this such a tough ask?  They don't even get near the uncanny valley. Highly off-putting, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.  I also don't think Felicity Jones can handle the lead role.  Even the 'young' version of herself was a stronger actress.  What made the movie was Alan T. as the new droid and the cast of supporting actors including Diego Luna and the blind force-believer (who is amazing)."
6,"As action flicks go, this one is too slow and talky, but does have a decent final battle. As Star Wars flicks go, it's a standalone with little of the legacy characters, a story that's tangential to the originals and no scrolling text at the beginning. A group of rebels sets out to steal the plans to the Death Star before it can destroy planets. The expected cool locations, technology and creatures dance around the edges, but there are no breakthru visuals or individuals to make this one stand out. The drama that dominates the first 90 minutes isn't especially compelling or interesting. Overall, it continues the legacy without bringing much new or exciting to its inheritance."
6,"Its not until the second half that you realize the importance of the story in the Star Wars world. I wish they had built it up better in the first half. But poor character development turns this movie. Second half is great and a treat for the eyes but the overall story was just rushed. It was disappointing that they didn't start with the Star Wars theme either. You can wait to watch it on bluray or stream it."
6,"Stars wars has become the Terminator franchise. First two movies were good but every one since has been average at best. This one was ok again. Nothing mind blowing and the robot K2 was the best actor. That says it all. I even thought the mexican guy was french until someone pointed out he was hispanic the next day. Anyway it wasnt bad but was just about average-ish. last 30 mins was the best part."
6,"I'm going to go with a 6 for this one, since I feel a 7 would just be too generous. I had some doubts about the whole 'Star Wars Story' thing in the first place, but the movie managed to get the looks of the Star Wars universe right, but the feeling was off from the get go. The grittiness of it all spoiled the fun quite a bit. The CGI was great, and there was no shortage of action near the end, but I still wonder why this movie was created at all. It doesn't fit with the Star Wars feeling except maybe for the space battle at the end. A pretty depressing war movie in the Star Wars universe. If this is the direction these Star Wars stories are going to take then they might as well call it a day right now."
6,"I don't know how to describe Rogue One for the first hour and half other than I was utterly bored out of my mind. However, the last thirty minutes were full and engrossing enough to salvage this troubled movie. But surely you can do better than that, Disney."
6,"This film was entertaining but ultimately adds up to less than the sum of its parts. The Good: The insane (amount and quality of) action, cinematography, and some performances. Felicity Jones and Ben Mendohlson did a lot with weak material and were seriously great. Alan Tudyk, Donnie Yen and Diego Luna's characters are cool. Certain cameos work really well. There's some poetry and clever visual ideas in the prolonged conflict in the third act, which almost makes up for the terrible first 1/2 of the movie (Jyn dispatches Stormtroopers with a stick... OK...). The action kind of feels like a kid playing with Star Wars action figures, in both good and bad ways. Oh and there's a monkey Rebel gunner.The Bad: Everything else. The script tries to be darker and more realistic but there's hardly any depths of conflict beyond 'good guys' VS 'bad guys' where one good guy is only slightly more morally compromised than the others. There's no character development whatsoever. The story overall is paint-by-the-numbers. A total missed opportunity there. Forest Whitaker's character dies early on for no reason. The score is weak. There is little dramatic drive because we all know how this story will end. Too much 'fan-service' and nostalgia. Callbacks to the original trilogy can only go so far.The Ugly: How much money this is going to make, undeservedly. Unless you REALLY need to see the epic finale on the big screen, just wait for it to hit home video."
6,"Unexpectedly good movie for a Star Wars. At least I've saw it out to the end unlike previous 'episode'. I'm not a fanboy of this 'fairy tale rubbish', but at last they've filmed something that makes sense and really reminded war to meet the movie title. Attractive Felicity Jones is a fine choice for the main role, but other staff are mediocre. Pathetic speeches are laughable and heroes behave unnaturally but still better than in most other SW 'episodes'. But what really bothers me is that 'rebels' are as much unsympathetic as Empire is. They are depicted as bunch of zealots willing to sacrifice their own and others lives for an unclear and morally ambiguous purpose - vague illusions and dreams. They are fanatics with dubious motivation. Even religious suicide bombers have more reason and logic in their doings than SW's rebels. At least they are expecting to end up in an imaginary 'paradise' and are dying for their 'brothers'. But all these rebels - what are they killing and dying for? As I said - they are scary zealots with irrational behaviour and no better than Imperial Stormtroopers. In fact, they are behaving utterly unrealistic. But this is SW after all."
6,"Surprisingly for me - this movie is OK! I expected it to be a total disaster. It didn't try to recreate anything, it's just a decent action/character story picture with a Star Wars paint over it. And even if they actually did break the barrier of the cringe here and there, I liked it a lot. Rolled my eyes a lot on some parts and still forced humour, but despite that, I still liked it. I was afraid that the 'diversity hurrr' gimmick will kill this movie, but even if some characters are weak, they were characters with personalities (maybe except them monk dudes and the main lead, which is Rey 2.0 who can barely act), not token characters.A quick meal that tastes good. Also, it's a relief to know that they ended all main characters in the same movie they were introduced in and don't plan to sequel their story."
6,"This is probably just me being bias against Star Wars ever since it was ruined for me by The Force Awakens last year, but I really do feel like I got burnt again by this series with this prequel/spinoff (or whatever you wanna call it.) Basically it's simply the exact same formula that's been used over and over again and is riddled with cliche moments throughout. Even the acting couldn't be helped, with Felicity Jones reduced to really cheap, and yes, cliche lines throughout along with the rest of the cast as well. And I don't even wanna start talking about the ridiculous CGI that was used to bring back some classic characters from the original trilogy and making them look younger again. Overall, this did nothing whatsoever to bring anything new to the table for Star Wars and is simply a further reminder to me why I'm really wanting to distance myself from Star Wars more and more. Keep it up Disney (not!)"
6,"So, just wanted to make a point and say that some of the best bits were missing from the trailers. Jin saying 'that's what I do, I rebel'. She sounded like a bad ass but the character ends up being somewhat diminished imo. Also the face off with the tie fighter on the tower looked spectacular but was also cut. On the plus side the new droid and Vader were AWESOME.  Film saved in the last five minutes. Looking forward to the Han Solo story."
6,"I have been a big fan of the Star Wars movies over the past several decades.  Rogue One definitely excelled on the action side; however, the characters were flat and most of the performances quite boring---especially Felicity Jones and Diego Luna.   Although I was rooting for their success in getting the plans for the death star, I felt almost no kinship or sympathy for them as characters.  I would say that Rogue One was a good action movie without a soul and without the magic that most of the Star Wars movie had.  The force was not with Rogue One."
6,"Rogue One follows Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones) a Rebellion soldier and criminal, who is about to experience her biggest challenge yet when Mon Mothma sets her out on a mission to steal the plans for the Death Star. With help from the Rebels, a master swordsman, and non-allied forces, Jyn will be in for something bigger than she thinks.I had my worries with Rogue One, if I must admit. After the massive success of 'The Force Awakens', the universe of Star Wars has now expanded even more. There's going to be more sequels, prequels, and spin-offs every year now. Why this worries me is because I fear I'm going to be sick of theses and not really get exited anymore. Star Wars should be treated like a three year event like before, it gives more time for the writers & director to really flesh out the story. It may seem like a long wait, but it'll be worth the wait. But that's not all. The trouble re shoots this went through and the ridiculous short deadlines during post-production. But after seeing the film myself, I can safely say that this new prequel isn't a bad one.'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is a good movie. Not great or amazing, just decent. In my opinion, it's not up there with 'A New Hope' or 'Empire Strikes Back'. It's more in the middle for me. If I have to be honest, I actually enjoyed 'Force Awakens' more than this. Yeah, I said it. The movie is flawed, but it dose have a lot to like about it.I can't imagine the pressure Gareth Edwards must have felt making this, kinda like what Abrams was feeling. In interviews, Gareth has said he was a Star Wars fan and it was the reason why he wanted to make movies. So this is very dear to him and while there where some slip ups in parts, but I must say that he handed the material really well. Gareth Edward is very good at making things feel huge and the heavy scale of things. The action scenes were directed so brilliantly that it actually felt like a war movie.That's what really surprised me about 'Rogue One' is how dark and depressing it is. Some people may have a problem with that, since everyone is use to these adventures with are favorite characters. For me, I didn't have an issue with it. Heck, I'm kinda glad it had the balls to go that far and be violent. The humor is very limited, but when there is humor is mostly from K-2SO (played by Alan Tudyk), who was just the best.The CGI in this movie was incredible and quite groundbreaking. I mean, it's TOO GOOD. The way it blended with the real life environment and the action scenes was so good that half of the time I was watching computer effect's on screen. How it was executed was so beautiful and quite the achievement.Now the biggest complaint I've been hearing from Star Wars fans is about Peter Cushing Digital Resurrection. Yep, he's back to cinematic life through the use of state-of-the-art visual effects wizardry. He's character Grand Moff Tarkin is in the movie, but instead of re-casting the role or kept his digital face in the shadows, but that's surprisingly not the case. He's in the movie quite a lot as you see him in full form and up close. This is getting a mix response from people and even I was a bit mixed on it. I was a bit weird out by it, as Peter Cushing has been dead for 22 years and seeing up there was hard to digest. But after letting it sink in, I thought it wasn't too noticeable and in a few scene I actually brought into it. I thought it looked real when he wasn't moving around or any close ups to his face. But that's just my thoughts.Speaking of bringing back old characters, Dark Vader makes a appears in this. While he's screen time is very short, but he steals every scene he's in. Eventually the hallway scene, that was so bad-ass and one of my favorite moments in the movie. It's great to see him and James Earl Jones back as one of greatest villains of all time.The first half of 'Rogue One' was a bit rough for me and I was kinda bored at times. I didn't care or got attracted to the characters. The characterization was lacking and that's a real shame, because Star Wars is all about the characters, as it's the thing we remember from these movies. It's not all about Lightsabers and battles, it's the characters. Felicity Jones, Alan Tudyk & Mads Mikkelsen characters were the only ones that I cared about. The others not so much.Another major part of the Star Wars movies is the score. John Williams score is so iconic that it's hard to top it. It's the heart of the series and I kinda wish he did the score for this, because Michael Giacchino score wasn't that good. But I'll cut Giacchino a little slack, he only had 4 weeks to compose it and it is a tough act to follow. That goes back to what I said about the deadlines being too short.'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is a good entry to the series and it dose feel like a dark Star Wars movie. I may have problems with the movie and I have to be honest with that, but I do think it ties in very well with 'A New Hope'."

6,"So here's a Star Wars movie that's not really a Star Wars movie. You get a whole bunch of new and dispensable characters most of which I've completely forgotten, a story that's missing the wow factor, a great soundtrack and a decent cast. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate this movie, there was some scenes I thoroughly enjoyed and honestly most of them were towards the end. Yet overall I was a little underwhelmed but can take comfort in the fact that this is not the worst Star Wars movie you could watch.However, let us not forget what this movie really is...a cash grab. A filler movie with some nice little bits of nostalgia to remind you that oh yes this IS a Star Wars movie. The inevitability of Disney owning Star Wars is we'll get a new movie every year and that might sound like a dream come true now but in the year 2040 with the 32nd Star Wars movie you'll wish you never heard the words Disney and Star Wars together. I'll recommend this because it's worth a watch once but if you're a Star Wars fan you'll go see this no matter what anyone says."
6,"Warning MAJOR SPOILERS TURN BACK IF YOU MUST. I was VERY excited to see Rouge one as I am with any star wars movie. Star wars is a very Exciting franchise and each movie leaves you in anticipation of what may hold in the newest movie. Did Rouge one disappoint me? No It had some really good moments and some flaws too. After reading critic reviews and audience reviews alike I feel I am the only one brave enough to give this a 6. Let's get down to the bottom of this review shall we? So first of all I really liked the character of Jyn Erso. Her character was not only well fleshed out but we care about her as a person and her fight for justice after we witness her father die as he turns his back on the empire. The actor who played her father was fantastic as well as the person who played mother. Gareth Edwards perfectly balanced nostalgia and really good cgi. He and his team of animators did very well at replacing passed away characters with new actors who played their part very well such as General Tarkin. Characters such as Darth Vader and Carrie fisher were replaced with CGI models and voice archives of that character to fit the timeline as this took place around the same time a new hope did. The Robot K-2SO was probably my most favorite chacter he was so sassy, funny and all around liable and was clearly the comic relief and it worked very well. The last scene with Darth Vader as everyone has been making a big fuss about is as good as everyone has been making it out too be. The final battle was brilliant and added a sort of world war 2 vibe too it However this is were the positives end. First the person who plays Riz Ahmed is probably the weakest actor out of the bunch. Also the character of Saw Guerrera was kinda pointless and did not add much to his character or the story.  You remember how we got a great backstory to make us care about the lead. Well that is nowhere too be found in the heroes pals. Donnie yen a blind solider who is part of Jyn's team of resistance fighters is fun too watch but he and Cassian are supposed to be friends but no good backstory is given to any of the characters except jyn which makes it hard for me too care about them when everyone expect jyn dies at the end. Which brings me to my next point. Nothing in this movie will surprise you. Now you may be thinking the robot never got any backstory why are you not giving him a hard time. The way the characters are set up the rebel fighters backstory is important as they are risking their lives to save humanity. They are not here too play the comic relief and are the main point of the story the robot is more of a side character. All in all their are many things too like about rouge one but the problems the plague it from being a great movie really keep it from being near perfect and are crucial if they wanted this to be a near perfect film."
6,"Rogue One is an ambitious film that's constantly hindered by the Studio's interference. Gareth Edwards (Director of films such as the independent film, Monsters, and the 2014 reboot of Godzilla) emphasizes slow build-up, scale and a sense of melancholy in his works. Rogue One, for the most part, uses Gareth's natural inclinations and makes a film less like the optimistic A New Hope and more like the bleak Empire Strikes Back. The film centers on Jyn Erso, a daughter of an ex-Imperial engineer who designed the plans of the Death Star. When Jyn's father is captured by the Empire and Jyn's mother is killed, Jyn joins the Rebellion as a means of survival. Years later, Jyn grows up to a be a jaded cynic, turning herself away from the cause. However, when a hologram of her father reappears, Jyn joins up with the new Rebellion in hopes of finding her father.Jyn joins up with a cast of rebels in order to fulfill her goal. Unfortunately, whether by mandate of the studio or Edwards himself,  a majority of the cast doesn't receive the much needed character development needed to form a strong emotional connection to them. (I'm told that a prequel novel, Catalyst, details many of the backstories and origins of the side characters. As I recall, there used to be a time when movies had to stand alone and didn't require the aid of a peripheral novel to explain characters). The stand outs of the cast are Donnie Yen's Chirrut mwe, a believer in the Force who cannot wield it makes the people around him question his figurative and literal blind faith and Alan Tudyk's K-S2O, a reprogrammed Imperial droid that can't help but say what's on his mind. While neither character full develops, the actors imbue their roles with such personality, that when the possibility of 'They will not come back from this mission' starts to sink in, you genuinely feel for their loss.Rogue One ordered a number of reshoots during production. Unfortunately, many of the studio's re-shoots stick out. Just when I felt that Gareth Edwards was about to take the Star Wars movies in a different and original direction (such as in the peripheral media or even the now non-canon Star Wars Extended Universe, a series of tie-in novels, books and games deleted from continuity by mandate of Disney purchasing the Star Wars license), there's a random cameo or reference that feels so out of place that it literally took me out of the movie. For example, Jyn, early on, bumps into the two strangers Luke meets in Mos Eisley. While the cameo is fun, it does little to move the plot or the characters. Perhaps, it's a small universe after all.And while I liked K-S2O's character, you can't help but feel every time he's in a scene, a humorous moment will be around the corner, effectively making him a comedic relief robot (I heard a poster refer to him as a Bazingabot).As such, there are moments of tonal whiplash throughout the film. Just as the film is about to take a darker turn or a depressing outlook, a random cameo appears or K-S2O says something funny. Were these moments intended from the beginning or did the studio worry that the film was too bleak and ordered reshoots to make the affair lighthearted? We may never know what Gareth's original cut of the film would've differed from what we have now. That being said, the director takes bold risks and does things to the characters a lesser director wouldn't have done. That takes guts. Rogue One is enjoyable. It is worth seeing in the theater. But, when I hear audiences compare this to Empire Strikes Back, I really wish the narrative would've taken more risks and Edwards would've been free to do what he intended. As for now, I recommend seeing it at a Matinee."
6,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is about as flawed as it is entertaining. With almost documentary-like camerawork, this is the most handheld Star Wars film by far, offering a more grounded and realistic feel, but the dialogue can feel cheesy and cliche at times. Very well shot but also very imperfectly shot, this film looks flat-out gorgeous. The editing can be a little choppy at times though, but that isnt anywhere near as distracting as the CGI version of Grand Moff Tarkin, as well as some other CGI characters. Which brings me to my biggest gripe - The characters. Likeable, funny, but thats about it - They lack any depth, background, or proper development, and we arent given any reason to care for them. Director Orson Krennic is an extremely weak villain and doesnt even compare to Darth Vader, who was only in TWO SCENES. This wouldnt have been as much of a complaint if the rest of the characters were more interesting, but it still wouldve been a stupid choice. The first act of the movie is quite messy, and feels like a series of loosely tied together scenes, jumping from location to location too quick and repetitively. There isnt really much else for me to say about the rest of the movie apart from the last act, which is a long if not too long action sequence, and although VERY entertaining and brilliantly directed, it has endless cliches and does get repetitive after awhile. Lacking any suspense that the previous Star Wars excelled at, this is a fun, decent ride with incredible effects but it is a very disappointing installment to the Star Wars franchise. I dont see there being any replay value either. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gets a 6 out of 10. Its decent."
6,"What's it about?It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. This is their story. What did I think?Where Return of the Jedi was a let-down due to 'alleged' toy company requirements, Rogue One seems a let-down by a meddling committee. Too many cooks dilute a terrific premise and muddy great characters thanks to an overly-convoluted introduction and dollops of unnecessary spoon-feeding.But make sure you see it on the big screen for the final battle sequence - it's basically a 21st-century version of the ROTJ final act.Epilogue: If you recall, we all loved Star Wars for George's ground-breaking 'used universe' and the mythical unanswered questions (Jedi, Clone Wars, why there is no underwear in space). Edwards delivers a gloriously dirty reality, but the committee let the movie down by interrupting him and providing us with too many answers to questions we didn't ask. A Star Wars movie doesn't require title cards to tell the audience where we are, that's part of the charm. Drop us in and let us swim!"
6,"The problem of Rogue One is not the technical part, which is compelling and incredible, but the lack of interest that produces either the plot and the characters. I understand to be amusing for those who are huge fans of the saga, but for me, there is no story to tell, and that, for a presigious name like Star Wars is something inadmisible. And lets be honest, Felicity Jones doesnt have any charisma."
6,"Okay, so the first spinoff of the immortal Star Wars saga has finally hit theaters, but how does it compare to the rest? Well, its miles ahead of those embarrassing prequels (no surprise), but Rogue One: A Star Wars Story just cant compete with the originals, or The Force Awakens.As Im sure youve heard, theres no opening crawl or John Williams score this time, just a silent view of space with a single planet. Everything else from here is an X-wing flight of an experience youd expect from a Star Wars movie, including booming sound effects and AT-AT walkers that look as epic as ever. Theres an appropriate mix of practical sets and good CGI to create all sorts of new settings, including a tropical planet and a claustrophobic prison. Its got all the checklist requirements to make a good Star Wars movie, but theres something missing.Basically, without giving anything away, the Death Star is in its finishing stages of development, and war zones land on all areas of conspiracy against the weapon, the strife of war affects the lowest of the low in the galaxy. But we are introduced to the struggle on a rock and moss planet that houses a small family of farmers. The father is forcefully invited to join the Empire, along with his wife and daughter. He is soon taken away, and the little girl manages to escape, only to be transported place to place by an Imperial prison as an adult.Now, she ends up with the Rebel Alliance so that she can be this movies feminist protagonist in helping steal the plans to the Death Star, and also to see her father again. You know how it all goes from here.The problem I had with this movie is not just in how we already know how it will end before it even begins, but in the excessive use of characters with so little humanity I cannot connect with a single one of them.Think of it this way: you remember how in The Force Awakens we saw a detailed introduction to Rey that showed us what her day-to-day life on Jakku was like? Remember the clear backstory given to Finn and how that motivated his actions? Here, none of the new characters have any of that. Jyns not motivated enough to fight for what she has lost, as we never know what her relationship with her father was ever like. Then she starts to cry over this inner pain, and let me tell you: Felicity Jones (Like Crazy, The Theory of Everything) is not skilled in making crocodile tears. Her story just moves by too quickly to balance a feel of hope with letting us feel for her.Everyone else around her is just a plot device. While Forest Whitakers (The Butler, The Last King of Scotland) new cyborg character has a sympathetic redemption story screaming to get out, the poor performance of the man behind the mask just doesnt land. Then theres the cameos of characters from the original trilogy. Remember how the appearances of older characters in The Force Awakens actually advanced the emotional story and improved your appreciation of the originals? This does none of that. Darth Vader does appear as epic as ever, but he just comes to explain the plot, and leaves, only to make one more brief appearance. There are a couple of others from the originals who appear, but none of them are very satisfying or necessary. Although there was one cameo that just blew my mind, making me go, Whoa! How did the visual effects crew make that possible?!But there is a god, strong saving grace though: one of the new characters proves to be strong with the force, despite it being a time when the force is thought of as an ancient religion. Hes also blind, and an epic master of hand-to-hand combat. Let me tell you: he gets a moment to shine in his fight against a gaggle of Stormtroopers, and its the most amazing thing ever.So is Rogue One: A Star Wars Story the spinoff to the saga we all hoped for? Not exactly. Its a satisfactory action flick if youre willing not to think too hard about it as high art. But if you are looking for the essential Star Wars experience that surpasses all of your expectations, you might end up disappointed."
6,"Stars Wars fanatic since summer of 77, with a few disappointments along the way. (Episodes  1 &7) This one gives me mixed feelings.  On the bad side: No crawl. No John Williams except a few 8 bar licks pasted in here and there. The beginning compresses about 5 minutes worth of plot into 90 minutes and despite the intermittent heavy duty action sequences, seemed somewhat boring. My bored-o-meter is usually rated on how many times I look at my watch during the film- more than once and its a dog, but I actually fell asleep (worse than looking at my watch) for about 90 seconds about 1 hour into this one! I didn't miss much.Now for the good:  Fundamentally, this movie is based on one line from what we now call 'A New Hope'. DV: 'Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.' The last 45 minutes gets around to this and it is a real thrill ride, ending with the perfect segue into Episode 4. Amidst the drama/action there are all the usual Star Wars things we have come to love- desperate space battles, impenetrable shields, storm troopers, AT-ATs, the Death Star, Vader at his darkest, and Episode 4 cameos left and right. I was totally satisfied with this ending. Too bad the beginning was so tedious."
6,"Not good. Lazy and overdone fan service. Vader casting was bad as he's not big/imposing enough. Tried to shoehorn diversity for the sake of making marketing people at Disney happy. The score was meh. The actual story/screenplay was just boring with poor banter and acting. The CGI for Tarkin and Leia was bad. Just stop. No need for that Leia scene. No excuse for them to not just cast a look alike. Locations jumped around way too much in the beginning. Zero chance a stormtrooper could not track Jyn to the rock inside the cave seeing as the ground is dirt and her footprints would have literally led them to her. This is a movie a Marvel fanboy eats up. Loud, bright colors, corny one-liners. I'm going to obviously watch it a second time and it's possible it might improve. Highly doubtful though. If so, a 7 is the highest I could go."
6,"This film is either being utterly praised or wrongfully bashed, but I think it's a good movie filled with some flaws, the great thing about Star Wars movies are the characters, the emotional bound you make as a spectator with them, the tragic story of Darth Vader, Han Solo, Luke, you get a sense of their motivations, their background, that made you feel bad with their death. Rogue one doesn't seem to manage that well, the characters seem to lack development.Another thing that is a negative for this movie is the CGI Tarkin, it's very good, almost flawless, but still, the CGI is distracting, and you could always tell that it was not a human there, you could have Guy Henry with practical make up, it would have a better effect than all the CGI in the world, or have him replaced by Vader since he could fill that role well.It was a great adventure movie, but still what I love about Star Wars, besides the Sci-Fi setting, the lightsabers, Sith vs Jedi, are the characters, and if you don't make me care about them that's just sloppy writting."
6,"To be honest, it lacks originality.  It seems like just another Star Wars movie, same old, same old.  It answers the age-old question - Why would there be a way to blow up the Death Star?  Was it a necessary movie to make?  Not really, but it's still worth watching."
6,"I have Rogue One a 60 score and here's why:The purposely restrained tone and dourness of Rogue One was a real drag. At two hours running time where you go in expecting a high energy action movie this is not a good thing. It felt like R1 was trying to be more Blade Runner than Star Wars, except without the intelligence, cast, and superior craftsmanship. I understand Rogue One is set during a time of war, but SW has always been able to attack serious issues without losing its lighthearted soul."
6,"While the movie has great visual effects, cinematography, and fan service (a lot), all these replaced character depth and a compelling story. Even episode VII had more relateable new characters. These were here just to advance a plot (a simple plot). The first 30 to 45 mins is pretty slow (and I don't mind slow if character depth is being provided/not the case), then we get to some great action which overstays its welcome by 20 mins."
6,"
I have mixed feelings with this movie. Love the way it connects to the original trilogy and it had great action sequences, but the characters were poorly developed and it seems to be an unnecesary story to tell.
"
5,"Sure, it was well produced, but frankly, this movie, while competent, was boring. The soundtrack was lousy, the characters were barely interesting to start and completely unmemorable by the end. It added absolutely nothing to the Star Wars universe. A total waste of time and money."
5,"This movie was exactly what I thought, nothing more nothing less. Nothing remotely interesting or clever about it. Just a long drawn out plot that probably could have been a really neat 1 hour short story. Zero attachment to the characters and generally uninteresting people... Though Chirrut was sort of neat. That being said the movie looked good, plot holes were filled nicely, and the little bit of comedy was fun. Again, probably would have loved it if it was a 1 hour short created only to feed into A New Hope."
5,"I didn't like it.  I enjoyed Star Wars 7, and the original three.  It seems like they were in a rush to make a Star Wars movie and just slapped a script together.  Also too loud, way too much score and not enough pauses without music to take in the subtle star wars sounds.  Too much exposition as well.  I get this was targeted at the kids but even though the original Star Wars is more mature I loved it as a kid.  Disney, please don't be in such a rush to recoup your 4 billion dollars that you release sub par Star Wars films."
5,"Great visuals, sound and all that, but if you are not a Star Wars fan, what does it offers? Unfortunately not much. To me, it felt like Disney milking another franchise. It was too long and boring at moments, acting not great, story not that interesting etc.I would very much prefer some modern adaptation, without the classic costumes, props and sets. That would be much harder and riskier to make, but there would be chance of making actually great movie."
5,"This edition to the Star Wars cinematic universe felt a lot to me like 'Suicide Squad'; great fan service and cool cast, but is ultimately empty due to undeveloped story and characters. Most Star Wars films begin with two protagonists, then as they journey throughout the galaxy we learn more about them as well as the world around them and the story itself. Then eventually the 'torch' is passed down to two new characters who we follow as the story continues.In short, the previous Star Wars films accomplished beautiful character, plot and world development at the exact same time. In 'Rogue One', however, the 'torch' is thrown around rapidly as the characters sit in a circle like a game of 'hot potato'. There is little to no character development, we're thrown around all over the place in the Star Wars universe, and the writers leave absolutely no time for its audience to emotionally invest in the story or characters (which is extremely disappointing for not only a Star Wars film, but for a film that is over TWO HOURS LONG).This is what its like for the first two-thirds of the film; while there is a lot of fan service to go around (which is expected from this film), the story and character development is simply atrocious. The third and final act, however, is what saves this movie from being an utter waste of time. This is when the action and threat becomes real and the characters finally come to life. If this film was just the final 40 minutes I would actually give this film a much higher rating.In conclusion, this series relies far more on fan-service of an already established Star Wars universe to please its audience rather than an actual (never mind 'original') story. Believe me when I say that, unless you are an absolute die-hard fan of the Star Wars franchise, you're better off simply re-watching the Original Trilogy if you want to watch Star Wars again.5/10"
5,"Over all the movie was good, but i could not handle the main heroine.I can bet the movie could've done much better without her, she is at the center of everything, doing just exposure commentary, much like if she was not there at all.The better, established lore-rich characters were underdeveloped or changed to catter to this tasteless heroine.See the movie again, imagine the scenes without her, you'll see, the movie not only does not change much, but any change is for the better.This was more a war movie in a star wars themed world, ratehr a Star Wars classic movie, and that was good.Gotta say, Disney sure wants to press the ' Disney princesses' even to star wars to the point of nearly ruining the plot of the movies."
5,"In a year where Hollywood has failed to deliver, the stage was set for Rogue One to steal the show, unfortunately that was not the case. Instead, Gareth Edwards gave us a Star Wars rendition that, while looking absolutely stunning, lacks any character and depth.Despite on the service being a movie that is, arguably, visually superior to The Force Awakens, Rogue One offers little more than fan-service and leaves no lasting effects for audience members that have yet to be indoctrinated into this Lucas/Disney cult. What went wrong?One of the most significant flaws of Rogue One is its protagonist, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). Jones' performance is utterly bland, especially when compared to last years predecessor Daisy Ridley, and she serves as more of a reference point for the audience instead of the charismatic leader that this film needed.Very little motivation for Jones, as well as the rest of the cliched ensemble, means that it becomes difficult for the audience to get invested in what was actually quite an enjoyable and acion-packed final act.This is a problem that I believe persists throughout Gareth Edward's filmography, most notably Godzilla (2014). While all his films do look visually stunning, he has yet to master the art of character development and when considering Rogue One's quite standard heist plot, the lack of engaging characters does mean that the film suffers heavily.Although I enjoy Episodes 4-7, I am far from a Star Wars buff but I can appreciate the level of fan service that Rogue One contains and I can understand why fanatics seem to enjoy this film. However, the persisting thought I have about this film is; why was this made? Of course it whets the appetites of those eager for Episode 8 but Rogue One leaves no enduring moments for the Star Wars universe and with the rich history and depth of the Star Wars canon, it is a shame that this films biggest achievement is being better than the prequels. As it turns out, that's not a very difficult task."
5,"they made 200 mill on it in first two weeks so obviously it is a good film. The only likable character who had that Star wars rebel personality of determined optimism, with that touch of charming naivety, was the droid, even Mon Mothma was a whinger (yes USA it is a real word it means whiny B**** but you can say it in front of your mum). All that matters is the box office and the opinions of the corporate lovers on this site who always seem to vote a product 9 or 10, maybe an eight if it poisons their grandmother. My comments are meant to reflect the tone of the film, jaded and depressive!"
5,"
Not good, not horrible.  Episode III.9 basically; filler with characters no one ever gets to know well enough to get attached to, I felt this movie was slow and emotionless.Michael Giaccino kinda spit all over Williams with his sub-par score, too.
"
5,"Oh boy how fanboys can be blind for such tedious, atrocious and lazy movie such this. It's so cliche, so predicted, like I don't even need to check the 'spoilers' box because it's too obvious and mainstream. Seems fanboys only want to watch clowns wearing star trooper outfits so they can jerk off on any movie. The '3D' effects are non-existent, I took off and on my glasses multiple times in the movie, it's almost like 2D but the blurriness in some scenes. My gf and I started yawning after 30 minutes from boredom (we finished our popcorn by that time). We felt asleep unless a big explosion or a light strike hits us in the face after about 20 minutes of dim scenes so it wakes us up. We couldn't know how to pass time, we started laughing at the 'fight scenes' and cuddling. We almost got tired and the movie can't finish. No wonder the stage was almost empty I expected not to find any tickets when I came to the movies, but because there was nothing interested to watch. Seems we are going to have the same lame movie again and again every year because fanboys will jerk to anything 'Star warsy'.And what about the female protagonist thing nowadays? Her staged and weak performance was nothing compared to Daisy Ridley, or now SJWs are controlling everything?Oh sorry, 'gf' means girlfriend. I know SW fanboys won't understand such shortcut. No wonder, jerking off to Darth Vader's ugly mask makes them sexodus."
5,"
I do not delivered as much excitement as any other film of the saga. Good play from Galen Erso and K-2SO. Other actors was bad. Movie is good as a cameo-film, like new ghostbusters.
"
5,"Dark, depressing, and mature. For better and for worse, this is arguably the least 'fun' I've had with a Star Wars film. The first entry in the anthology series creates a darker tone intended for older audiences hoping to have their nostalgia itch scratched as opposed to younger audiences hoping for an upbeat and fresh narrative. Personally, I'm in the camp that thinks Star Wars is currently in a state of narrative stagnation. We've seen the death star multiple times with both Lucas and Abrams. We've seen the orphan narrative with Luke, Rey, and now Erso. We've seen the comedic droid with C3P0, R2-D2, BB-8, and now K-2S0. It gave me an odd feeling of deja vu. Havent I seen this movie before? Its indicative of either a concerning lack of creativity, or a fear of experimentation due to the sacred cow status of the Star Wars franchise. Rent if youre a fan of the original trilogy. Avoid if not."

The movie highly differs from Director's original version, and has been destroyed by Disney wanting to re-shot a lot of parts of it at the last moment.

5,"I kept thinking 'did THIS many people have 19th century British accents in all the other films....the other accents all being European?'. My friend & I had trouble staying awake just like many others have mentioned....& yes the end was colorful & exciting (especially Darth Vader 'sashaying' through....all I'm sayin').I barely knew what was going on half the time, dialog sounded like those royalty history movies, just with intergalactic subject matter (but how would Luke, Leah & Han EVER hang out with these people'?).I sort've plan on seeing it again, hopefully I'll piece the story together better the 2nd time.I wouldn't say it's bad. It does fall into place well as the backstory of A New Hope. But I'd probably only recommend to people with a good attention span....there's a LOT of dialog delivered with that one-note 'what I'm saying is IMPORTANT' tone.  I liked Felicity Jones in A Theory Of Everything (basically the wife who gets dumped for being boring), but her character is pretty boring here too & always had the same 'scowl with a mouth full of walnuts' look. Maybe everyone was directed that way & she nailed it....after all no character was anyone you'd want to have a beer with.Maybe the robot."
5,"A movie which tries desperately to recreate the magic of the original trilogy failing it's goal. A bad soundtrack as we've never seen on Star Wars before, a meaningless plot, useless characters with no charm who add nothing to the Star Wars mithology. A junble of CGI characters who could have compleately been avoided. After all we were able to do worse than the sequel trilogy, but this time with no Jar-Jar. P.s.: What the f*** went wrong with Darth Vader armor?P.p.s.: After all Vader smashing rebels was great!"
5,"IT bored me and felt a bit long but had its moments. Everyone gets blown up which is upsetting but Vader has a badass scene and it opens up for a new hope"
5,"This film generates mixed feelings.  On the good side the visuals excel, the ending is superb and there are some wonderful moments.  It adds significantly to the impact of Star Wars: A New Hope by focusing on the sacrifices made to get the plans to Leia.On the downside the film fails to generate an emotional connection with the characters, which is its major sin.  The main character is poorly done, the story is complex and unconvincing and its overlong and boring at times. A missed opportunity."
5,"The movie is full of super effects and tons of fighting scenes, this is normal for typical science-fiction film. I like the fact that, director doesn't try to promote the movie using sexual scenes, and this is not kind of 'heroes should survive', but I didn't find this movie interesting, there are funny moments in the movie though."
5,"While Rogue One stands on its own as a movie, it's storyline is somewhat Hollywood-ized and not very unique. Perhaps using Star Wars as a theme it mixes the tomfoolery of Guardians of the Galaxy with some elements of Expendables (yikes!) last ditch efforts to bring to you an interesting portion of the overall Star Wars storyline.  As a movie goer, my expectations were lowered due to the reboot/rehash nature of Force Awakens, but having watched it now, I'm quite indifferent as to if it is something I would watch again. It was nice to know what they were thinking I suppose, but as a movie itself, I think it was merely ho hum and 5/6 out of 10 at best."
5,"Its a star wars movie. That's good. tie fighters, death stars, corellian corvettes, space battles and storm troopers. YAYbut. meh.There's obvious symbolism. the filmatic movement from darkness to light, representing despair to hope. but belaboured, and makes the movie hard to watch for the first forever. 50 shades of, well, darkness and that's all there is to see.Then there's the lack of gravitas. The monologues are just that little bit too long and quite frankly i didn't care enough about the boring bearded dudes to care. And the star, is it Jen? no, its Jin. or something, she's not quite got the method down pat and I dropped out of the movie world several times when she was obviously acting.Then there's the style. The first movement is all chop chop chop, switching frantically between worlds, clumsy exposition, not feeling much like a star wars movie, more like a complex detective film noir, which then changes mood halfway though and tries to pull a thin red line, or something.I guess it did manage to build a sense of the human (and alien) cost of the plans that luke comes across in a new hope. there's that word again. They said it enough.Then there's the 3D. The Force Awakens nailed it, and it was brilliant. Rouge One? meh. I like to look around each scene, take in the other players, check out the scenery, the sets. In Rouge One, the focal plane is really small, so only the person that the director wants you to look at is in focus (and even then they are often obstructed by shoulders or objects). Everyone else is blurry. So i spent a lot of time looking at a blurry person, waiting for the focus to shift so i could see them properly. Not so much in the second half, but it was a real irritant for the first half. This was compounded by a constant, unnecessary, shaky cam. So 3D added a tiny bit to the movie, but took more than it gave.And dear GOD. please never use that CGI technique for people's faces EVER AGAIN. I'll have nightmares. So BADthe droid was good."

Movie is ok... but its not star wars. No Kyle Katarn in death star story = Not star wars. Stop falsely labeling movies to fans, Disney. We fail to recognize Disney's changes as canon.

4,"This movie was surprisingly bland and non-fun to watch.For the record, I gave last years new Star Wars movie a 10/10 rating.This year, we have the same great visuals, visual design and probably the best ever story told in the time of the movie Franchise.Plenty of good actors, but: while the actors were great and the story was outstanding, both the writing and the acting were sub-par. I suspect poor direction.The movie presses way too hard on a number of Star Wars cliches (force guy, hey, let's mention the force every sentence, huge space battle for a stationary target at the end, OMG, my relationship with my Dad and foster Dad is strained, everyone who dies dies a heroic death...)Fewer characters with more development would have helped the movie along tremendously. Terrible shame, this movie could have been the greatest one yet."
4,"Better than episode VII but I wouldn't even call that a movie.Music is off like in VII, and it does not have Star Wars feel...which is I guess a good thing by now.James Earl Jones Vader voice does not sound right...only the first sentence he said was spot on other is like he's in some pain, to high pitched, strange.But Vader scenes were only god thing in the movie...I thought by trailers he would be more involved at the end...don't have a clue why did they cut it he's just fan service as it is like CGI Leia and Tarkin. Better if they used Wayne Pygram.Felicity was only descent actor in the movie beside Vader presence...I mean wtf. happened to you Forest Whitaker...he's like Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending, its THAT bad.Direction is terrible, you could cut at least 30 min. and story is really minimal. Some fine actors are really bad (Mikkelsen, Whitaker). It does steal from original but not that shameless like VII and it stole ending from deep impact. lolThere is no one terrible thing beside THAT shallow droid...its the same thing from Interstellar, same monotonic LAME, soulless and completely UNFUNNY waste of screen space. Why again no R2-D2 or C-3PO instead of him? Is selling toys really that important? Who would buy this generic boring droid? At the end its completely pointless movie as expected. It could have been a great movie with competent director and completely new script that had more old droids and Vader as main antagonist."
4,"Tale of two movies. First half terrible - confusing, poor character development, dark and not enjoyable to watch. Then it is like the director was told to stop making a bad movie. The characters lightened up as did the tone, and the pacing and action became a star wars movie. The second half of the movie takes place in space and on a cool planet with a palm tree filled beach. It has as a bit of Return of the Jedi feel with the story switching back and forth.   Overall rent this movie and skip ahead to the very beginning of the beach scene, and you will have an enjoyable 45 min long film."
4,"Wow...another 'Star Wars' movie...zzzzzz. Despite a somewhat promising beginning and some dazzling special effects throughout, this latest offering in the franchise quickly degenerates into yet another tired, predictable slog that goes on far too long, provides no particularly new insights into the mythology and has an ending that's already known from the outset. Unless you're an uber fan and can't live without seeing absolutely everything in the 'Star Wars' mythos, don't waste your time on this underwhelming, half-hearted effort."
4,"Worst star wars movie. I did like the Darth Vader seen though because it felt like it was part of a better movie. And it's cool how it ends pretty much right before the fourth one. I was a little sad not because all of the forgettable characters die but because, well, it's the worst star wars movie and feel the spin offs will continue to be that way. I'm still interested in VIII though."
4,"'The Force Awakens' though not the worst in the series was the weakest on story since it was a thinly disguised rehash, and of course story is the most important aspect of any narrative movie.  This one is even worse pertaining to story.  It looks fantastic yeah, and has a reality to the photography that goes beyond even the last entry.  That's the progression of technology.  Stunning visual effects used to mean something, but now since it's a given for not only the genre but all big studio fare (and is expected particularly from this series which started the whole VFX blockbuster long running trend) what matters more than ever is the story-telling.  This thing is so predictably formulaic in its telling of a small backstory alluded to in the original film, it offers practically no surprises at all.  No story surprises that is.  There is nothing really in this feature that one doesn't automatically intuit from the trailers.  It's another connect the dots enterprise with all the little winks to fans which actually somehow shrinks the entire legacy every time they close in this vast universe by keying into every little story detail they can find from the old films.  Plot beats arcane canon acknowledgments any day nerds!How many times can we watch the same repetitive action tropes no matter what galaxy they're set in and still be thrilled?  Continuous action and spectacle is not good story craft.  Too much 'action' equals boredom.  This is a real problem for the medium in general, I understand, but it must be fought.  For example, why not get bold and creative and go into some strange subplots revolving around certain characters?  Go unexpected every chance!  That's good story-telling.  That's what 'Game of Thrones' does.  That's why that is far superior story-telling nowadays than 'Star Wars' is.  Diversity in casting is only a diversion from the real task which is all that matters, story.  It's not that the casting here is a problem, it's just that it's irrelevant no matter how much attention it may get.  The fact this movie has the fewest stars yet in the cast is not necessarily a problem either, but without big stars or familiar characters to pull you along and give personality to the generic proceedings it gets very dull.  And most detrimental of all, this suffers from the same wretched problem the prequels and last year's reboot sequel did.  In the case of the prequels, playing out mysterious and intriguing backstory by actually rendering and extending what was a couple lines in the original script into a bloated forefront has killed the magic once there.  What was huge has become somehow small in so doing.  By the same token with Episode VII, seeing what happens to beloved characters well into the future only serves to dampen our imaginings of them.  In both cases, it only taints the original couple films from way back.  Hey this is the very nature of sequels and prequels I know, so there's no solution other than to either do them so exceedingly well that they transcend this problem or don't do them at all, especially if dealing with classics or returning after prolonged periods of time.  Or just keep putting out stuff like these last two movies which are good enough, sound enough productions to still make a fortune based on an overwhelmingly large and beholden fan base but in the long run will ultimately continue to harm the franchise and damage its value.It's too bad because this is a sophisticated product with the conceit of a really good war mission story cleverly extracted from the seed planted in the original 1977 film.  The tone is right, serious but light enough here and there.  The problem is it's one hell of a slog through with a lot of watch checking!  There are flourishes, but nothing that can come close to saving a sophisticated audience from either being bored out of their minds or lying to themselves that this was an entertaining couple of hours.  Be honest with yourself.  There are a couple very powerful fleeting moments.  If the whole movie was on such level it would be the best!  As it stands, it made me want to play the virtual reality game version instead of sitting through endlessly recycled narrative.  The story has to grip more than ever these days or it's a waste of time, because we have seen it all over and over and over!The best movies for kids are the ones that adults can also love.  The first two 'Star Wars' movies were that like we'd never seen before.  Unfortunately the magic has never been re-captured since."

The last 30 minutes or so are pretty great. The rest of the movie is mind-numbingly boring, though. Cool space battle, bad characters and writing. The Vader scene is okay aswell.
"
4,"Rogue one isn't a bad movie yet it is somehow tedious to watch. The characters, especially Jyn, are bland and uncaptivating. In TFA at least Rey and Kylo are fun enough to watch. The core plot is actually decent, the execution however is such a mess that it never got me interested in what was going on.The star wars franchise has always been great at creating new worlds. In rogue one however half of the movie is in a place called Jedha which has a middle eastern setting. The name itself would tell that it is a homophone of Jeddah. It is so unoriginal that the actual Jedha might as well be somewhere in middle east. How lazy are the writers to not come up with a more interesting setting?The events in Scarif are decent. The stormtroopers are still fodders as per tradition and the empire is so incompetent that you wonder why the resistance lost to such army. The battles are at least (barely) believable. Also the characters are not protected by the invincible plot armor worn by the main characters in TFA which makes it a lot more interesting.The whole movie might be worth watching just for the Vader scenes. Those scenes remind me why star wars were so good and why rouge one isn't. A movie wthout jedis, siths, lightsabers and the force is not Star Wars."

This was a C movie at best. Poorly written, too much fan service. A letdown like The Force Awakens was.  I don't think Disney has the magic to make a good Star Wars movie.
"
4,"first half is boring and nothing happens (with only 1 exception), second half is pew-pew bang-bang only. The longest battle in entire SW history.The only good things are about the final part where there are a lot of connections with A New Hope, but Rogue One is mediocre at its best"

Bland story while clever is to cliche to enjoy with throw away characters that might as well be cliches in human cloths. There some good action and the film does look the part, but it can't make up for what little it has.
"
4,"Being a life-long Star Wars fan, I had high hopes upon entering this film. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. The first 10 mins of the movie is constant shifting between different locations without establishing what purpose they have. They end up just being names on the screen with no meaning.Characters are incredibly underdeveloped and the movie just expects you to feel for them.Forest Whitaker's character was completely pointless.Some sort of mind-control alien was introduced and then completely ignored after.The main villain Krennic had a lot of potential but that is never realized.The main character Jyn, is suddenly overcome with a sense of duty to complete this mission, despite having spent her entire life avoiding responsibility.The chinese characters decide to just join the group because plot demands it?I thought the Grand Moff Tarkin revival was appropriate and well done, I dont think the complaints are merited. Galen Erso was my favorite character and more of this movie should have been spent on him and his relationship with Krennic.Vader's final scene was the best of the film. The character should have been featured more prominently.The CGI of the film was great. Locations were gorgeous.Unfortunately the lame plot and characters are too much to ignore and over weigh the few positives.If you are a Star Wars fan, you will obviously go see it, otherwise dont bother."
4,"A good popcorn film that helps pass the time but where is the danger?  It was advertised as a tougher, grittier version in the Star Wars lore but any time things got to serious one of the characters would toss in a joke to ease the tension. As Disney does with their marvel films, the Star Wars universe has fully been Disneyfied, with safe storys, humour and generic music to set the mood. I found the score felt out of place in a few scenes while watching the movie. The characters felt flat, especially Mikkelson and Mendelsohn both fantastic actors who were wasted. I am a Star Wars fan but after the disappointment of Force Awakens this doesnt do much to excite me for the upcoming series. On a positive note, seeing Darth Vader fight down that corridor excited the geek in me."
4,"I have never truly enjoyed any of the 'Star Wars' movies. Seen all of them except 'Force Awakens'  which I tried to watch on a flight and got so bored after about eight minutes that switched to something else. Not that it was badly done. I just couldn't find anything to care about.But I can dig why many people like or even love the Lucas seminal creation. It's the same reason why many still love Elvis Presley, The Beatles or, say, Frank Sinatra. When the first 'SW' came out in 1977, it was phenomenal cultural event in a sense that today's cinema lovers can't quite fathom.The age of blockbuster movies had barely begun, the sci-fi movies in general had never been mass friendly  it was a dry, intellectual or just downright trashy field, and always geek-oriented. And the wider audience had never had a chance to experience such a big-scale, detail-rich, lovingly crafted made up universe. Sure, the screenplays have always been mediocre. Even 'SW' creator George Lucas has freely admitted that he was not a good writer. But fans were happy to satisfy with style and quantity because these movies sure do have lot to offer to the eyes: places, characters, action, design, details... Don't forget that blockbuster movies were still a new thing. The next trilogy, released from 1999 to 2005, never received the same amount of love because people were much more used to screen spectacles than in 1977-1983. They still admired the visuals and Lucas's team's world creating skills. But it just wasn't the same.And that may be the reason why I never cared about 'SW'. I stepped on Lucas's train so late that I had already my firm beliefs about what good story means. I had seen seen many big screen extravaganzas already and acquired a taste for more depth than usual blockbusters are prepared to offer.Still, I decided to give 'Rogue One' a go. The reviewers have already praised the fresh approach where we have a strong female hero and how there's no clear line between good and evil side before and how plays out like a war movie, etc.But watching it myself, I instantly remembered why I don't care about 'SW': * new faces on screen but the same style of wooden acting and dialogue that feels like characters just reciting their lines instead of really talking to each other* characters have almost zero depth so there's no really argument for being interested in them, if you are not 'SW' fan which makes you interested already* I didn't acquire a cohesive sense of time and place, just a series of scenes which don't always connect to a greater whole and often don't even have a proper flow. * For most of the time, 'Rogue One' felt like a bunch a short movies that are connected by faces and places. Like a picture book where you have to concentrate only on one or two pages at a time. And many of those pages are not even exciting, maybe due to hammy acting and depthless characters.* The only part that feels like more than a series of loosely connected scenes is the rebel attack which can really be compared to war movie in its own right.What I liked about 'Rogue One' was this female hero everyone's talking about who never plays on the gender card but acts like a soldier on the battlefield as everybody else. And the visuals are cool as always, all these pictoresque places, interesting details, awe-inducing battles. And, of course, the war movie part. And the heartfelt prologue. So for me, as a person who doesn't swallow 'SW' hype easily, there is maybe an hour of adventure interesting enough for watching and another hour and ten minutes just enduring and hoping it will not get too boring."
4,"The story is just 'meh', while the characters are forgettable. The visuals are mostly nice, but that's about it.Everything you need to know about what happens comes from the first act, and all the times people picked on the glaring weakness of the Death Star. The motive laid plain and bare, with enough crumbs to make a cookie out of. As for the rest of the story, there's really nothing there. They just slog through the motions, which didn't really make me want to find out how they lead into Episode 4. Anyone who knows anything about the films would know that none of the characters important to the story would be coming back. So you would think they would at least try to make them a bit more memorable or worthwhile. Instead we get a 20-some teenager who initially could care less about the rebels that has an out of place change of heart because the story called for it, their backup character who was setup to become the friction on the team but doesn't really cause anything to happen, and droid sidekick who is more memorable than the rest of the cast combined (seriously, it's like someone who knew the flaws of the script wrote their lines).They get teamed up with an attempt at an odd couple of a blind monk that follows the force like a religion, and a heavy weapons dwarf that doesn't buy into it. The monk is perhaps the second memorable character due to the staff fighting, which turns into a bow-like blaster. They also try to fill the mystical all seeing character, but most of the attempts are rather... forced. As for the heavy weapons dwarf, that's really the best way to describe them because they could have been replaced with just about any other kind of character and no one would have been the wiser. There is a part at the end where they have a change of heart, but it comes such a stereotypical moment and feels so out of place.Then there's the pilot they pick up. Initially they were important because of a message they were trying to relay to the rebels. Instead he runs into some extremist who don't trust what he has to say, so they use a giant brain leach to snack on the guy's memory. Afterwards he's left in a holding cell to rot after the unhealthy dose of brain damage, but somehow returns from becoming a mindless doll and quickly turns into a competent member of the team. Then they become important in giving the team the call sign 'rouge one' in which is met with the obvious 'there is no rouge one, there is now' moment, and CinemaSins coming in with 'roll credits' (ding)As for the rest of the film, there's a few things that'll appear in Episode 4, but they're mostly there as a wink and a nod to assure the audience that this is (much like the title says) a Star Wars story. Even Darth Vader's appearance in the film feels like it was added just for the sake of getting people hyped to see what amounts to manufactured plot with no character development. Everything is done because the plot demands it. They even allude to things that might have made better features, but leave them as a cliffs notes because they got to get through the two and a half hour film. Kinda makes me think it would have been better as a TV series instead, because then we might actually have a chance to connect with the characters.Though apparently now Vader has a dark sense of humor for some reason? It was so awkward of a joke that no one laughed. As a matter of fact, no one in the theater had any reaction to anything in the film at all. The awe and spectacle of the original series just wasn't there for this film. Even when they fired the Death Star twice, the whole thing comes off as under powered and weak when compared to the original.Aside from all that, most of the visuals were nice. When the Death Star eclipsed the sun before firing did add a nice touch, and the appearance of Vader at the end was done well. Aside from that, the film isn't worth a fraction of the hype it received. If it were any other franchise, Rouge One would have been direct to DVD."
4,"Me: Good fan fiction. Fanboy: It is official!Me: Oh boy. It is fan service from beginning to end. The characters seem interesting, but I don't know I haven't had time to know them. Except that robot. He didn't take **** from anyone and was a straight shooter. I liked that."
3,"Rogue One is the story of the Rebels who fight to acquire the plans to the Death Star that Princess Leia has at the start of Episode IV. The cast includes a Rebel assassin, a wise-cracking robot, and a girl whose farming family is invaded by Stormtroopers and her mother killed while her father is drug off. Fifteen years later, shes back, trying to get the plans to the Death Star from her father so that the Rebellion can destroy the superweapon.This is a generic modern action movie with the Star Wars branding on it. The first third or so is disjointed. While unlike The Force Awakens it feels like it is telling its own story, and it feels like it fits into the verse, it also feels like it is disconnected from it - a bunch of people fight and die, all to set up a plot point at the start of Episode 4.There are two real problems:1)	The movie is poorly plotted. The start of the movie is disjointed; theres a bunch of scenes awkwardly stuck together that dont really end up feeling like they properly stick to each other. Later on, there's literally an entire planet that the group goes to in the middle of the film which serves no purpose whatsoever. It could have been cut and they wouldn't have had a problem  indeed, one of the characters in the movie even specifically suggests not going to that planet, instead suggesting first going to the final planet where the climax of the movie ultimately happens.Even the final battle sequence doesnt feel particularly well tied-together. In the original Star Wars, every death in the final sequence felt like it was directed towards the goal of defeating the Death Star  and every death made it feel like the rebels were that much closer to failure. In the climactic battle at the end of this movie, however, many of the good guys who die are nearly faceless, and even the named characters deaths feel like theyre extraneous to the plot  simply being killed off after they complete some task, both obviously and arbitrarily. And frankly, one of them simply dies pointlessly, with no actual purpose to his death, while doing something that didnt matter at all to the climax of the movie.This results in the ending of the movie feeling like it is kind of a generic action sequence where only a small portion of what were seeing actually matters. Only one death there actually felt at all tragic, and that was the one character who was actually directly contributing to their success at the time of their death. Theres little coherence to the final scene.2)	The characters arent particularly memorable. K-2SO, the reprogrammed imperial droid, is amusing and is the most memorable character in the movie. Almost all of the movies laugh lines are directed at him. Chirrut Imwe, the blind monk with faith in the force, has some memorability, and theres at least one good laugh line directed at him. Saw Gerra, the rebel extremist at the start of the movie, seems like he might be vaguely interesting, but ultimately very little is done with him before he is unceremoniously killed off towards the end of the first act.Everyone else  including the two leading characters, were pretty non-memorable. I could barely even remember their names after I left the theater. And thats never a really good sign. Not caring about your main cast, and them feeling like theyre kind of generic action movie heroes, just makes it hard to care about anything else in the movie.Ultimately, this isnt really something you need to watch. There are better action movies and movies with better plots. There isnt even a light saber battle in this movie. In the end, it feels like a bunch of references to the original Star Wars trilogy, particularly A New Hope, all stuck together in an attempt to make Disney lots of money with the brand name.It will work. But it shouldnt. There are better movies for you to spend your time and money on."
3,"Honestly the worst Star Wars film I've seen and a huge **** you' to long-time Star Wars fans. Story was underdeveloped, it underestimates viewer's intelligence and is a complete insult to Expanded Universe. It's like non-canonical fan film with a 100 million dollar budget that was rushed out before its time. And I'll never forgive them for casting Kyle Katarn away into a meaningless role. That made this film uncanonical in my head and I have to ignore that this film even exists. GCI was great and action was great. And I like that it's a more serious Star Wars film for adults. However it's a dumb Hollywood blockbuster film without actual substance in it.Characters were unnatural, completely void of any kind of personality and their lines were poorly written & poorly thought as well. They have a bit of a Mary Sue as their leading character as well. She always has answer to everything and is just about perfect in any kind of sense including a perfect sob-story as her background. Also the film gives a strong impression that the roles where given based on external factors like actors' & actresses' ethnicity and not their actual skills as actors. The actors behave like complete wooden blocks which might or might not be an intentional thing given how the plot progresses. But hey at least it's 'diverse' which to some people seems to be more important than actual good acting, good writing, good directing, good visual art, good music and many other things which usually make up a good film.This film also tries to distance itself from other Star Wars films in various ways which is probably not a good idea considering how we're expecting certain things to be in Star Wars films and without them it just doesn't feel right. It feels more like a trashy fan-film that degrades the value of Star Wars in our eyes. Disney needs to stop this. They're making too many films too fast. And while Episode VII was barely acceptable I just cannot give Rogue One free pass."
3,"Self-important, cliched tripe. No personality or character. Feels like it was made in committee. I am truly astonished that so many critics liked it. Instantly forgettable with characters I couldn't care less about. Stop making these terrible movies, Disney!"
3,"All Star Wars die hard fans please don't read any further because this review of 'Star Wars: A Star Wars Story' will make you very mad!! 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is loud, noisy, boring and, except for 4-5 lines that are funny, not at all original. Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of the series will know where it is heading from the introduction of Felicity Jones, as Jyn Erso who is the daughter of scientist Galen played, by Mads Mikkelsen. Without giving away any plot if the daughter had listened to the father about a mistake he made on purpose the picture would have been only an hour instead of the 2 hour 13 minute running time.The movie has more wars than all the Star Wars pictures combined plus one of the loudest soundtracks heard in a long time. The CGI effects are out of this world, no pun intended, and in some cases amazing as an actor who has been dead over 22 years is very much alive, another looks 40 years younger and another who is in their 80s sounds like a teenager! They are the set up for the very first Star Wars movie ever made though the ending leaves nothing in doubt.I wasn't familiar with many of the leading actors but I was impressed with Donnie Yen as a blind monk, Wen Jiang as a warrior, Riz Ahmed a pilot and Diego Luna as one of the leading rebels. Oh yes, a nod of the head to Alan Tudyk for the wisecracking 7-8 foot droid K-2SO. Forest Whitaker is wasted in a cameo which really has nothing to do with what the screenplay by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy is heading for and director Gareth Edwards is all over the screen in the action scenes and only hits the warmer minutes towards the end of the film.Oh I forgot to mention Ben Mendelsohn's villain maybe because he is forgettable?I am not a fan of Star Wars or sci-fi films and told Allen he is on his own for future Star Wars films.Unless you are a fanatical fan of the series or a couple of CGI effects regarding people I would suggest staying away."
3,"It might be unpopular opinion with some Star Wars fans, but I hate this movie.  I'll explain.Firstly, a lot of what makes Star Wars, Star Wars, is absent.  No Jedi vs Sith light saber fights here.  No Jedi at all actually.  Vader is a fun presence in the movie, while he's on screen for all of 5 minutes in a 2 hour movie, but he's only in it for 5 minutes.  There's a lot of little references to A New Hope, that I'm sure fans enjoyed, but they're pretty forced.Jedi aside, one of my favorite things about the original trilogy was the banter between Leia and Han.  Nothing really resembling that here.  Or the daring getaways in the millennium falcon.... again, not really.What there is here, is a by the numbers simple rebel rebellion war movie, crippled by a need to give constant nostalgic nods to better movies of the past, and a PG-13 rating.  I hear people calling this one 'gritty'.  Compared to what exactly?  Certainly not compared to an actual war movie, like this is doing a poor job of trying to mimic.  Gritty compared to a Disney cartoon?  Well, maybe not even that.  No cussing, no blood, no dark references of any kind... This is a wannabe war movie sanitized for little kids.That's a problem, however, since the first 2 thirds of the movie involves a LOT of standing around talking, nothing happening, with boring characters.  Children will be bored.  Very bored.  Adults who aren't huge Star Wars fans should be bored.  It's a stupid predictable plot, with paper thin characters, and bad dialogue.  Trying to end on a positive note.... There was a good scene with Vader (about 3 minutes long), that I enjoyed, and K-2SO can be pretty funny sometimes.  So, about maybe 10 minutes of good stuff in this 2 hour movie for this guy.  What do I have this at?  A 4?  Thinking about this better, lets lower that down a notch.  A 3.  For the 3 good minutes that had Vader doing cool stuff."
3,"Disappointing To the positive: Class CGI and good effects The scenes are unique Therefore visually one of the best films of the year. But why the bad assessment of me? Quite simply. As a very big fan of episode 4-6 the quality of the action is only dull and is bad. Episode from 1 to 3 were quite bad, however were not so bad as here. Unimaginative dialogues and blows central figures pull the film quite strongly under it. There it also does not help if the death star and the star destroyer are present. Lord Vader Auftritt is to yawn. I would have not thought one even deeper sink than in episode 7."
3,"In terms of special effects the movie does a good job with lots of eye candy and some impressive CGI to bring back the Tarkin. Unfortunately the movie is obviously and intentionally racist against white males. A non-white male core cast (white female, Asian, Mexican, Pakistani) vs an all white male Empire cast in this day and age makes it quite clear that this movie was designed to hate on white males. Pretty pathetic."
3,"action is B, maybe B+ being generous. Characters are forgettable and underdeveloped. The tone would be better off if it was a mix of dark/action packed and fun/fantasy driven, but it's all dark/action packed, and especially going into New Hope, it really feels like an awkward transition."
3,"Almost fell asleep halfway though. The ending was a nice nostalgia payoff, but I'm wondering why I spent 2 hours and five minutes to get to it.A film you could skip completely and it wouldn't matter one bit. I wasn't a big fan of TFA, but I'd rather sit through that twice back to back than this once more. Just a 'nothing' movie."
3,"The movie has a few nice moments of course, but when we realize that the droid K-2SO is the most memorable character (with no facial expressions) of the whole film it's a bit saddening. Of course the visuals are nicely done, but the action scenes are long and boring as well as the scenes based on dialogs between them. Director Krennic is well played but very one dimensional. Chirrut Imwe's character repeating the same sentence all over again becomes really annoying after a while. There's an important Jedi temple in the movie and we don't get any information of it. We don't even see it from inside and I guess that would have been quite important for most of the fans... So all togeather I have to say it was a disappointment."
3,"Rogue One is what you get when you get a good script for one 5-minutes special DVD additional backstory special, and producers stretch it just enough to fit a full length film. The fact that the whole plot can be described (with details!) in a single sentence is enough proof of its lack of substance. Fans will not care and cinemas will love it."
3,"I feel asleep for about a half an hour watching this.  It was missing something for me and the fact the main protagonist was basically a midget kind of took me out the the immersion. When it gets right down for it I only popped for about 5 mins of the movie.  And we all know what that was."

3,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first of many, many stand-alone Star Wars movies.Rogue one sets place a few weeks before A New Hope. And follows multiple main characters with no backstory.The main problem with Rogue One is that everything in the film feels like fan service. From the CGI Grand Moff Tarkin to R2-D2 and C3-PO pointlessly being in the movie. The plot is rather... meh. It's mainly just: Travel to this planet, do this thing and fly to another planet. This keeps going every main character dies at the end. Which, I guess we're supposed to care about? Although, none of the characters had any backstory other than they hated the Empire since they were a child. And our 'Heroes' doesn't really feel like heroes, they straight up murder innocent civilians and Rebel troops.And for some reason Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader are back, although they do almost nothing in the movie. Tarkin could easily be replaced by a new character since all he did was wanting to see if the Death Star worked. And Darth Vader serves to purpose other than being there for fan service, even the ending where he kills some Rebel troops could and should have been replaced by some Stormtroopers. But, since this is Star Wars you have to prop in as many Original trilogy refrences as possible to get more people to buy tickets.In the end, Rogue One is better than The Force Awakens, but way worse than the Original trilogy. And it's not really worth seeing unless you want to see Disney dishonor a memorable character by making him CGI."
3,"Bland, boring, incohesive, and cheap action  the opposite of a good space-epic. This is easily the most lacking Star Wars film to date. You are jettisoned into a story with no developed background and are forced to follow poorly developed/established characters who change very little. Poor emotional connections and robotically delivered lines (save for Ben Mendelsohn and Grand Moff Tarkin/Peter Cushing's roles.) This is in part due to a finicky storyline and inconsistent editing. The visual impact seems lacking and sub-par especially compared to the more grandiose scoring and sound design that won the Star Wars films so many awards previously. It feels small. There aren't any awe-inspiring shots, something trademark to a science-fiction film of this caliber. The films editing and score appear rushed with no room to settle. The cast, either due to poor scriptwriting or bad directing on Gareth Edward's part, seemed utterly disinterested in any of their parts and remained unconvincing. Felicity Jones lacks the humanity, rationalism, and vigor of the wonderful Leia Organa (her CGI face at the end looked horrid.) 'I rebel!' Cool story, Jyn. Other characters, such as Jyn's father, resemble the same lifeless shells. For all of the supposed torment and anguish him and his family seem to go through he shows little of that in his acting.As a long-time Star Wars fan I can safely say this film and 'Episode VII: TFA' feel nothing like the Star Wars universe George Lucas was brilliant enough to create. The spaceship designs, planets, alien creatures, characters, plot, and the visual/audio combination feel ingenuine and a step away from the George Lucas universe."
3,"-	Too many obvious Easter eggs. Gareth and the writers think we enjoy these. We dont. Star Wars had ZERO references to other SW movies, so you dont need them. You think you are being clever or cute, you are not. They are annoying and make me cringe. -	Rolled my eyes constantly, I dont need to see the morons from the Cantina scene who picked a fight with luke. 1) It takes me out of the movie as I realize immediately you are waving a giant easter egg in my face. 2) This is stupid as was this tatoonine? Am I to assume the drunk degenerates where smart enough to leave on time? -	Death Start plans on a single removable hard drive, far away from armed guards in a tower that just so also happens to have a communications tower that can upload assumingly a non imperial encrypted code? What drugs was Mr. Weizz taking? -	Too many clichs, the bad guy shows up at the end and is about to shoot the heroine when someone off screen shoots him, seriously this happens in like 30 other movies, can you think of something more original? Obviously not. -	Main Character isnt remotely likeable. Our first impression of the grown up version of her? She punches the people who save her. Seriously? Who does that who is likeable? Nobody. The likeable hero, would have had a chance to escape, but risked herself to save a child on board. Yeah, a bit of a clich, but considering the movie is full of them, one more wouldnt have been so bad. -	The Forest Whitaker Character is pointless. He is paranoid of spies coming to kill him, but when sees obvious danger, he decides to stand and face the CG wall of sand death? Lame -	They should have snuck on board the death star to get the plans. The blind guy should have turned out to be a Jedi and fought Darth Vader, movie would have been 10x better on that alone.   -	I am every bit as big of a Fan as the next person and as a real star wars fan and not some bot who gave it a 10. If Disney keeps trying to stuff their politics and lecture us rather than entertain us, then they are going to lose us and ruin one of the best franchises ever made. For what? It is almost as if the teenage humanity majoring older sister who hated hearing her younger brother play with his star wars toys went and got a job in the lucas film story department, just so she could get revenge. Please for the love of all that is good and decent, stop ruining this franchise or I am going to become rich and buy the rights to The Notebook and everything else you care about and do remakes to exact revenge!!"
3,"Movie is LOONG and boring, you will literally be sitting in the theater for an hour and a half before the movie starts picking up and getting decent. I will say this about the actual movie, I'm not going to include spoilers. The characters aren't going to grow on you, this is not an 'Epic tale', you probably won't remember the character's names a month from now after seeing this movie.  This is not Starwars,this is not the franchise we grew up on. And thats why I'm giving this movie a bad review, I'm not going to give it a 'Free pass' just because it's starwars. Also with that being said, most of the people that I know personally that like the movie are pure George Lucas haters, they hate everything George Lucas did, and love everything he didn't do. They couldn't name one thing they really loved about the movie other than the action towards the end/the ending.  I can't name a single thing I personally liked other than the action, so Hence the 3/10 score.  FAILAs a side note I will say this is how I personally rank the SWs movies. 1-8 1 being the best1.) A New Hope   2.) The Empire Strikes back3.) Return of the Jedi4.)Revenge of the Sith5.)The Force Awakens6.)The Phantom Menace7.)Star Wars Rogue One8.)The Clone WarsI am an avid Starwars fan, and to be honest Rogue on had less going for it than Clone Wars. The characters were that bad and they just couldn't convince me enough through poor acting (With a few major exceptions), and a poor/poorly written plot to care about them. I mean this is my personal opinion, I'm not telling you to not watch the movie, you should just lower your expectations so you won't be disappointed, or you might even like it more than you expected you would, the action scenes are great, but lets be real here if thats all it takes to make a good movie Taken 1/2 would be 8-9/10s."
3,"Went to see last night and in one word disappointing.Have been a Star Wars fanatic since I was 10,It just didn't grab me like The Force Awakens did.I hate to say it but I found Rogue One boring.Not that it was a bad movie but I felt that for a Star Wars movie it fell well short of my expectations.I would give it a 2 out of 5.Might go and see it again but I am not in a hurry to do so"
3,"Dreadfully disappointing. Spammy,amateurish acting; unwieldy structured plot; interminably drawn out sequences; tepid, inscrutable dialogue fit for a UN boardroom. Its a clock watcher. To further prevent one from immersing into fantasy, the oddly rendered CGI characters distracted the mind towards the glitchy, strangeness of their appearance, and movement. Also bears the worst acting I think I've ever witnessed. The actor playing Cassian - could he emote, and commit to a scene more anaemically? The characters were so one dimensional, that I just didn't care about them or their mission. Cue boredom. Given how great were the rest of the special effects, and set production that's saying something. Worst one of the lot. So glad it's over."
3,"I was a big fan of episodes 4,5, and 6.  I loved Espisode 7; it's not my favorite, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Rogue One is sticky, bunghole crap.  The accents of the actors/actresses make it difficult to follow the dialogue and the plot.  It almost feels like Disney wants to expand their audience and cater to Europeans in this film by adding accents.  There is absolutely no evolution of the plot (in fact the Kyle Katarn plot is completely obliterated!) and some of the directorial choices are just plain silly (the frickin' dialogue.....lordy).One of my biggest complaints concerns the digital dopplegangers of Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia.  Did anyone look at these digital incarnations..... pardon me, abominations, and maybe think they were a terrible idea.  The CG version of Leia is more palatable because she is shown for such a short duration, but Tarkin is shown extensively and he looks like some awkward Japanese sex-robot trying to fool a lonely person into thinking he is real.The plot is just a mess.  The whole premise of this small group of 'rogues' taking on the Empire is not in any way bravado, it just makes the Empire look they belong on the short bus.  It comes across as a ridiculous suicide mission where everything goes their way.  Did you really have to waste the IP Man (Donnie Yen) and make him pull that lever?  Who thought that was a good idea?  Overall, this a turd burglar of film.  When the prequels were out a decade ago everyone pretended like they were passable when they were steaming, hot garbage.  This movie belongs in the same chute.  Yes it gritty, and more violent than the other Star Wars flicks, but the story is just rubbish.  Gareth and Lucas should hang out and talk about more ways to attempt to ruin one of the greatest franchises ever."
3,"Movie jumps around in the beginning, establishes no emotional connection, does a lot of 'telling' instead of 'showing'.By the time the action picks up pace you have no reason to care about any of these people. It should have been a simple story, but they found a way to **** it up."
3,"This movie is garbage. The characters suck and are completely forgettable, the rebellion is made to look dickish and hard to care for, the stakes never come off as anything other than small, the dialogue is embarrassing and the editing is a joke. If you enjoy this movie, then congratulations, you're an idiot."

A turd dressed up pretty in cgi... is still a turd... this movie are boring character and some action the end. Nostalgia is not enough to make this movie any good.
"
2,"Yawn!!.... I did not realize they would milk this franchise so early on. I figured we would at least get 1 solid trilogy before the fluff started. The story was non existent... I did not make a connection to any of the characters except the robot. 2 movies about a death star.... It's fiction... Fiction means you can make anything up... anything... I will not be going to the theaters to see any more of theses... i'll wait until they come out on Netflix."
2,"Star Wars: Rogue one is most likely the worst movie of the year. I would of given it a higher score except it does not deserve anything higher than 2 stars(1 Star for Nostalgia, 1 Star to prop up all the zeroes this movie will get). please do not see this movie or take ones that you love to see this disaster."
2,"Way too long for a movie this uninteresting. Dialogue is awful, and sometimes annoying (Blind Character). No Force practitioner in any of the past movies has to chant a mantra, it was just annoying. Characters are dull especially main leads, and supporting cast are wasted Mads Mikkelsen, and Forest Whitaker especially.The Rebel Alliance makes it sound like he is some really tough terrorist but that is not how Whitaker plays the part. Space battle doesn't make since, they are attacking shield for five minutes, and blowing up aircraft guns, and not until near the end of the battle do the TIE fighters come out of the shield give me a break. Darth Vader scene is the best of the movie, was hoping a Jedi would show up but no such luck. Wait for rental definitely."
2,"The movie starts in a secluded farm being attacked by the empire, where our protagonist loses their family. Well this is familiar, like the Force Awakens this movie depends on the established franchise for both material and audience.  After telling the backstory of the female lead(the only backstory we get)a backstory that was both unneeded and incomplete, as the female lead explains what we were shown and weren't shown. We are introduce to my least favorite character the male lead, with a accent so think and whispers so much I couldn't understand half of what he said. The scene that introduces him tries to make him look like a person who is ready to make hard sacrifices, but it makes look like someone is over his head and panics at the drop of a hat.  We learn the rebels are sending in a team to get the plans to the Deathstar, from a pilot that defected and was captured by Whitaker who the rebels have had past dealings with. The rebels recruit the female lead to talk to him, because he took her in after she lost her family(Obi-wan/Luke). When female lead arrives at Whitakers' place, the pilot tells her that her father was the one who sent him to meet the rebels. That her father was building the Deathstar, and he wanted to inform the rebels of a weakness he put in it(retcon?). The planet they are on is attacked by the Deathstar and Whitaker decides to stay on the planet and dies because reasons?   The Rebel team tells the rebel commanders about the deathstar and the plans the female leads father has. And they did't believe her, even though it was the point of sending her there in the first place. As the rebel team goes to meet the female leads father, rebel command tells male lead kill to her father. This makes no sense as they don't have the plans yet and the Deathstar is working and dose not need him. Male lead decides not kill him because character growth? The rebel team tries to talk to female leads father, but rebel command bombs the place they are at. Which again makes no sense as the bombers have no idea if the rebel team is in the area, or whether or not they have the plans(plans they can't get if they're dead). and the bombers kill the dad before he give them any data.   So the rebel team regroups at base, where the Rebel commanders are questioning fighting the empire and female lead gives a bland inspiring speech. Even though her reason for joining the rebels was because they forced her to, not to mention they kind of killed her father. So the team decides to steal the Deathstar plans from a empire data center, one you think the dad would have sent them to in the first place(it has more plans than just the Deathstar).  Where a space battle occurs and a really tiny rebel ship pushes star destroyer into another one(this is just silly that this works). Once they get the plans on a rebel ship, the Deathstar shows up and kills the rebel team on the planet. Even though there was no reason to as the rebels were losing and it was an EMPIRE planet.So the movie ends. I couldn't remember any of the characters names, much less care about them. The comedic dialog was like someone telling a funny joke they knew, but was really bad at telling it. There are some bad CGI characters that did not needed to be CGI. This movie has the same funk as The Force Awaken. In that it tries to relie on the franchises' fanbase, but has to change or add stuff that doesn't belong in some odd attempt to say 'we did it better than George Lucas'. This movie is half way between The Force Awakens and Star Wars Rebels, if you like one you might enjoy this movies"
2,"Deserving of the flak, the prequels were extremely disappointing for sure. But Rogue One has to go down as one of the biggest disappointments of the entire Star Wars series. Convoluted, joyless and dull throughout, the only saving grace here is the ending, which does a grand job of leading through to Episode 4. Sadly this is the worst movie of the entire series."
2,"I just walked out on this sophomoric movie.  The plot line was quite weak.  The CGI was good.  But the writers are unequipped as far as originality is concerned.  It's a tired plot with no thought other than for the action sequences which are predictable."
2,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a massive disappointment. It's only saving grace is the advanced cgi that really adds a touch of beauty, but besides from that i absolutely hated it and feel like there is something i don't get that makes this movie a 7.8. In the theater, i clapped at the end when the main characters die, good riddance. I feel that most of the good reviews are based on it's star-wariness, but it is practically an abomination composed of various scenes that already exist in star wars, except for the slug mind-rape scene, that scene was pretty god damn original, great way to make the movie exciting. Also killing off all the characters does not make them interesting. But hey Disney, keep making more of these, if anything this movie has proven that we will consume anything from Disney, no questions asked, including some f-ing meth, cause meth makes you intelligent."
2,"For me this is one is quite boring, slept for about 20 min at the first part of the movie. Everything is so so predictable. I got to give 10 out of 10 tho for the CG FX, except those CGI characters. I see no point of seeing a movie explaining that death star has a weakness."
1,"No heart, nothing that made you love the series to begin with. It is just talking, then a gun fight, more talking, another gun fight, repeat, repeat, repeat. I fell asleep at one point. I don't know whether the screenwriters are that bad, the director butchered what they gave him, or the producer doesn't care except to deliver a product. Disney should be paying you to watch. See it on TV. The production values are excellent but it is emotionally vacant except for some cliches. Believe it or not it is even worse than the Lucas Star Wars films of the 90s and I thought nothing could go that low again. If you have never seen a Star Wars movie and are 12 years old or yonger then this movie is OK. What I couldn't figure out was why does Rey act like a boy for the whole movie? She dressed like a boy, talked like a boy, and acted like boy. Are we now ashamed of being a woman? Also two major plot holes. The first one is 3 minutes in which is a terrible sign that they think the audience is stupid."
1,"Good:Darth Vader.Bad:The the other 2 hours 12 minutes...It looked like Star Wars, however aside from that it completely misfires.  It failed to capture the essence of or even seem to understand what Star Wars is.  Poor character development (They slammed to door on even revisiting any of them).  The movie itself is a cobbled together mess that jumps around enough to give one a headache.  Overall it falls way short of being even a mediocre Star Wars film and is simply a bad movie.On the bright side, EP1 is no longer on the bottom of the list."
1,"You're going to be bored 90% of the film. The lead female, male, and villain all lack charisma; you won't care about any of them. The plotlines and conflicts are bafflingly disjointed. For instance, a conflict will be set up, then end up going no where, and it was a weird place for conflict to arise from to begin with.The side characters are fun, but underused."
1,"After the heartbreaking disappointment that was episode 7, Rogue One does very little to get Star Wars back on track. Rogue One fails on every level with the exception of a few cool action scenes.Just like how Force Awakens is a rehash of A New Hope and Legacy of the Force, with Rey and Kylo Ren acting as the replacements for Jacen and Jaina Solo, Rogue One is just a rehash of Dark Forces, with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna being replacements for Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors, just nowhere near as likable or endearing as the originals. In addition, the premise itself is predictable and uninspiring, and the movie doesn't add anything to the overall mythos.Do yourself a favor,and just don't watch this movie. It is not worth it. If anything, this movie is confirmation that no matter what we want, we are being given one thing, and that's what they're telling we want. This movie will leave you with this crushing sense of inevitability, like the fans don't matter. Because ultimately, with Disney in charge of Lucasfilm, they don't matter."
1,"So I already know that the whole movie will do the same like the previous Disney creation and I had true on that. So what was the problem again. The story switching scenes so fast. Ununderstandable characters. Why are the characters sometimes know nothing then know everything. Why Disney killed the Force real franchise now anybody can use Force. Which is a joke. Are we getting a good movie ever by Disney or Star Wars will be the most challanging movie for others except Lucas. Lucas was the god of Star Wars nobody can remake them ever. Thats the truth. Anybody who blame me think about the mood of the Lucas version Star Wars movies. Then watch Disney one. They have so much difference. There are many kind of people in the world. I can understand who loves crap movie. I am not the person who watch anything and say it was good. No critics need to blame the person to make a movie which worth to watch. I hate Hollywood right now killing old franchise. Same DC Universe do. Also Marvel with Spiderman or X-Men. How easy to ruin something but how hard to make something new and perfect. Thats why we can easily destroy anything it is the easiest thing. Because we built it and we can destroy."
1,"'Rebbelions are built on hope.' My hope for Disney's Star Wars died (again). Movie is slow, bland and just doesn't feel like Star Wars. Characters are shallow and are poorly developed.There are too many stupid moments. Remember AT-ATs in Battle of Hoth? 'That armor is too strong for blasters!' Yeah right, Galen must have tinkered with them too, because lazors are now destroying those AT-ATs effortlessly without hitting weak spots. Even ordinary blaster is enough to damage their legs. And that's just one example of many. WHAT THE #*@# GUYS?! The Empire is depicted as incompetent bunch of fools. I started to feel bad and sorry for them, not for oppressed rebbellion. Trained, regular army with unlimited funds is just clueless on battlefield (just like Disney).The only bright side is that the movie is not as bad as 'The Force Awakens'. Very close though."
1,"Boring blockbuster without nothing especial only 30 min of action if you dont fall sleep before.  They are some really good actors wasted in this film, I cant care for this characters not even the robot they are unoriginal and boring. And some scenes from the trailer doesnt appear in the movie, thats really crappy. For me thats the last star wars movie from disney watched on bigscreen, this franchise its dead for now."
0,"I don't know how this movie has gotten such good reviews.  It was simply terrible, and I really wanted to like it.  But it was just so bad on so many levels.  Most notable was how Boring and predictable the story was, like a 12 year old wrote it.  There are a bunch of new characters that you never get to really know or care about. The plot is just like trudging through mud.  It was like watching someone play a video game. The film makers seemed to enjoy themselves while we are hanging around not at all engaged.  Recreating old characters like Grand Moff Tarkin out of special effects was just dreadfully creepy.  Once these digital recreations start talking the special effects reveal that your watching a digital puppet show.  Its pretty bad.I wonder if the Disney machine is hiring people to write positive reviews because this movie is just so awful to have to sit through."
0,"The film was pointless. It has got to be the most pointless film in the history of pointless films.Hey guys we already knew that the plans were stolen, and where they were stolen from, and we also already knew what happened to the stolen plans and even to the people stealing those plans. It was how the original films kicked off, and it was all rather self explanatory.But I suppose there is some kind of a starwars geek somewhere else in that other galaxy far far and away who needed another explanation into that rather simple explanation. I suppose you'd really think so? After thinking, hey guys why haven't they got any starwars diversity, because with a galaxy full of alien factions and races you'd think there would be more than just some other token humanoids bringing to life the cartoon version, but they didn't did they?"

A movie without identity, it tries to copy things from a terrorist thriller to a vietnam war movie but it fails to find his soul. It is like a Space Rambo movie with Darth Vader in the background.

3,"Arrival is being called one of the best Science Fiction films in years. It is one of the best rated and reviewed films of 2016, and is drawing comparisons to Close Encounters of The Third Kind, but I have a question, did they watch the same film that I did? I wasn't crazy about Close Encounters, but that movie was leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Twelve alien crafts land in random places all across the planet, and the people are in a panic. Some countries react with hostility, but the U.S. Government decides to act cautiously (yeah right), and send Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the best linguist they have, to figure out a way to community with the aliens. The aliens, turn out to be giant octopus, whose language turns out to be ink that they squirt into the air. This movie features flashbacks and flash-forwards, that seemingly make no sense, until the end when you finally figure out what they mean and once you do, you realize that you just wasted two hours of your life. If that wasn't bad enough, the film moves at an absolute snails pace, I mean you could take everything that actually happened in the film and squeeze it into about twenty minutes. The rest is just people talking to each other about the same damn thing over and over again. Trying to figure out the same thing over and over again. Worrying about the same things over and over again. The characters have no personality whatsoever, and you might think that it's one of those slow moving weird films that all comes together in an amazing ending, but no, it doesn't. Once you can see the whole picture, as one lady in the theater so eloquently shouted out, 'really, that's it, that was so stupid.' Her uncontrolled outburst really sums up this entire film. Honestly I think the slower and more artistic a film is, the more the critics love it, but I am one critic who isn't fooled by great actors and emotional music, this isn't the best film of the year, this is the biggest turd of the year, and it should be avoided at all costs!"

As other have commented, Villeneuve is a good director but this is a step in the wrong direction for him. I hate to use the B word {boring}, but Arrival is a real endurance test even for fans of serious, thought provoking movies.
"
4,"Denis Villeneuve is a talented and promising filmmaker, 'Prisoners' being an obvious benchmark. While I'm still looking forward to his Blade Runner sequel I have to say Arrival was a huge disappointment. Amy Adams great performance notwithstanding, this was a ponderous, superficially profound movie that ultimately goes nowhere."

Just like Villeneuve's other films, this one has proved that he is one of the greatest director nowadays. The way that he approaches a common theme in movies is almost revolutionary.
"
6,"Much has been said of Amy Adams's acting in this film. The praise is richly deserved but that's where the accolades should end. Great acting rarely makes great films and this movie is not great, despite my sincerest desire for it to be so. Greatness in theatre or cinema usually requires great characters (or less often, a highly original storyline). Arrival has neither and Adams's character, the linguist Louise Banks, who dominates the screen time, is little more than a sketch for a oil painting Villeneuve and his writers are unable to complete. The film has been hyped by the critics as a serious, intellectual alien encounter sci-fi that outshines all the comic book treatments of this trope. It's certainly serious but rather brainless at the same time. The science is minimal ('hey, I've discovered that 0.0833 recurring is 1 divided by 12') and the linguistics a mere ornament. But worse than that, it's a little boring. The social commentary is unremarkable, the philosophical content hackneyed ('hey I've discovered that love conquers all') and the ending a hasty conclusion to a fabricated tease. That's two disappointing films in a row for Villeneuvehardly a good omen for the Blade Runner sequel."

5,"This is a science fiction movie about aliens visiting our planet. Or rather about attempts the mankind takes trying to establish a contact with aliens.The movie is done quite professionally, and I liked it's cinematography and sound track.There are good actors starring there (Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker), and they deliver adequate performance. Most of the movie kept me interested. Sometimes pseudo-philosophical lingo carried me away. I think the movie was too long, and the script has not been thought through, leading to nowhere. Which is a shame, it had a lot of potential."
0,"Viewer be warned.  Preview contains all the 'excitement' of this supposedly 'clever' sci-fi movie (very sad).  Actually, this has been grossly overhyped by professional film critics.  I would like to have my money back if possible.  Dark, slow, incoherent plot that challenge you to stay awake.  Tried my very hardest to enjoy this movie, but failed to do so.  One film critic graciously rated this as: wait until it comes out in DVD.  My vote: skip this movie and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.  In summary, I feel scammed by the professional film critics, similar to the many fake reviews on Amazon."
1,"Nothing here that hasn't been done a thousand times. Simple time loop paradox. If you're looking for a movie about aliens, this is not it. It really has nothing to do at all with aliens. It's a weak tug at heart strings depicting a story about a parent that loses a child. The chemistry between the two main actors is non existent. Just a terrible waste of 2 hours."

The movie preview showed aircraft flying overhead.  This was the only action in the entire movie.  A low budget, slow, out of focus movie.  Watching paint dry has more action.  A rare film that wanted to make me demand my money back.

2,"I went to see Arrival sort of reluctantly because I am not into sci-fi movies with aliens coming to take the world over and a war ensues between the good guys (us) and the Bad (the aliens) and we always win. It was a choice of seeing this movie or Rules Dont Apply and I am not a fan of Warren Beattys and I understand it is really a flop so I decided on Arrival.The main reasons I was interested in seeing Arrival was because I am becoming a big fan of Amy Adams and on YouTube I saw a video titled Arrival Ending Explained which intrigued me though I didnt watch it until after I saw the movie.The first hour of the movie was like watching a foreign language film without subtitles and didnt hold me interest at all. The second hour with the 12 egg-shaped UFOs all over the world set up the standard them versus us but that isnt where it goes.Amy Adams is Dr. Louise Banks, is a language expert, who had a daughter who died at the age of 12, and is called on to help make contact with the aliens who are named Abbot & Costello by the theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner, who brings the  very rare humor in the movie. They work together in ways not exactly up to what Colonel Weber, (Forest Whitaker) and a CIA agent played by Michael Stuhlbarg want from them.The film revolves around Adams and Renner with little time for the other actors except for an important cameo by Tzi Ma who plays the Chinese leader though it is Adams who holds your attention every time she is on screen which is through the whole film.The film is not about them versus us but about time and how it can be looked at in different ways. We see many scenes with the mother and daughter from birth until her death 12 years later and by the ending these scenes all are looked at in a way that we werent aware while watching them.The ending is done subtly by the director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer instead of hammering the audience over the head but I really wished I had watched that YouTube video before I saw the film.Adams performance is constrained, as it should be, where it could have been melodramatic. When it comes to her what it all is about she calmly accepts and understands what is happening and what happened. Renner is very strong support for her performance.This is not an entertaining film in the sense you can sit back, munch on your popcorn and enjoy aliens invading earth but to which you have to think.Arrival for the most part is a boring film except for the last 15 minutes and I didnt think the time invested was really worth the first 101 minutes and time is what the film is all about."

Not great. As others have said, it is slow. Also, it feels like they just did a wikipedia search for 'linguistics' and then wrote a script around the first paragraph. I don't see this as a cerebral sci fi film at all. More of a cheesy, slog-fest.

1,"An 'alien' film to leave you totally alienated! This is so self-important and ponderously dull that it makes Ingmar Bergman's depressive dramas seem like comic farces. The screenplay is all **** and pretension in which Amy Adams' language specialist amazingly deciphers the black ink vocabulary of the extra-terrestrials in record breaking time. A feat that only ever happens in the movies. The creatures themselves look like a cross between giant squids and an elephant's foot, and it's no exaggeration to state that their presence is underwhelming. The first ten minutes promise much but we never get that film. Instead as soon as the alien pods arrive degeneration in to boredom is immediate and sleep inducingly effective. Praised by the highbrow critics, make no mistake this is alarmingly over rated. A totally confused and uninteresting example of the sci-fi genre. Arrive? It certainly did. However, I couldn't wait to leave!"
6,"This one is getting reviewed higher than I believe it deserves, so I will reply.  I love Denis Villeneuve's other movies, and the cinematography and general quality of this one is consistent.  We get lost in being too philosophical and digging for a big philosophical point, but never really finding it, I felt. Simple as that."
1,"Arrival stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker in this sci-fi drama written by  Eric Heisserer based on a novel by Ted Chiang (The Story of Your Life). The film was directed by Denis Villanueve who, together with the writer and the editor, if there was one, must take full responsibility for the 2 hours I wasted watching their product. The movie is slow, confusing and complicated and the scenes float back in time and place without ever clearly indicating what was intended by its creative team. Ms. Adams can do no wrong for she is a talented actor but somehow she got placed in this amateurish attempt at a modern day ET. The film is not only a disservice to Ms. Adams talent but to the audience that must suffer through the picture  as well. I must have looked at my watch at least 5X during the course of the film and, in so doing,  found the hands on my timepiece more interesting that that which was being projected on to the screen. What amazes me most is that so many professional critics found this movie to be worthy of their highest rating, again proving that being paid for an opinion doesnt mean it has value. I give this film a 1.0 rating and if I hadnt been in the company of my wife and friends, I would have walked out of the theater mid way through it. The only recommendation I can make about this film is to respectfully suggest to Ms. Adams that she  hire a new talent agent.."
5,"Being a sci-fi buff I was anxious to see this film. It was not all I hoped it would be. Repeated scenes over & over lost the interest of the audience as I could feel. The acting was average and the sub plot was difficult to follow. Just couldn't rate it as some have."
6,"I don't mind that the film is slow.  2001 is a slow movie and I love every frame of it.  This movie is boring at times.  I looked at my watch a couple of times.  I don't believe we could decipher the complex symbols as quickly as they did, and I always have to wonder why super intelligent beings have a hard time learning our language(s).  I also felt ZERO chemistry between the two leads.  I also thought about the movie 'Contact' several times as there is too many similarities.  On the positive side, the visuals are striking at times, and Amy Adams is wonderful, as she is in every film she is in."
5,"Can I be honest? This movie doesn't have any sense? What 'precious' message aliens have for the Humanity? after half hour I completely lost interest watching the movie that was turning into a no sense plot. After Indipendece day any other Sci-Fi movies has been able to be plausible (for what possible), exciting and with a simple as much as deep story. Disappointed"
1,"This movie develops at 1m/hr to make sure the convoluted mystery can be understood... except if you're of average intelligence or above, it's just a boring crawl to you.  The payoff is in no-way worth sitting through the whole thing.  Just read spoilers and save money and time.  I suggest that the film maker look at movies like Memento.  You can have a smart intelligent twisty mysterious and still be thrilling and entertaining all the way through."
5,"As a thought-provoking movie, Arrival is over-rated drivel.  Amy Adams is a good actor, and she does yeomans work here, but she breaks no new ground.   The movie is a Fail almost every other level.  Forest Whitaker is wooden, and The Notebook like story within a story is lame.Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist, trying to figure out how to speak to aliens that have arrived at earth in dark, giant, scary looking, pods that look like slag. The aliens have no spoken or alphabet based written language.   Instead, the aliens converse using ink blots (which look like the stain that a wine glass might leave on a cardboard coaster, and made me wonder if the writer came up with the whole idea while sitting at a bar.)  Equally boring and conventional are the aliens.  (Why do aliens always seem to have squid-like bodies?)Dr. Banks is apparently the only gifted linguist left in the world, and the govt seeks out her expertise to the exclusion of all others.  (Ugh!)  Dr. Banks speculates that the aliens are so advanced that they have no apparent way to communicate with humans, and thus it is up to the humans to figure out how to communicate with them.  (Groan!)  For Kumbaya reasons, the aliens have split the message they want to convey to the people of earth into 12 parts, and use 12 different space craft to deliver it to 12 different populations across the earth. (Ay Yi Yi!)  Of course, the reaction of earth people is to go loot Best Buy and then try to blow up the aliens.There is a story within the story about time travel (Oh no!) and Amy Adams daughter who, we learn early on, has died from some rare disease.  This is supposed to give the movie its heart, but when you separate out the two movies halves, neither part has enough weight to give the movie any real substance.  As far as director Denis Vileneuve goes, I liked his work in Sicario.  Arrival is a step backwards."
2,"Let's face it, a story like this hasn't crossed the paths of viewers only once before, right? I thoroughly enjoyed the actors in this production. Kudos for the CGI (thank goodness there was a lot of grays available). Question me this: Why did her hands shake? What was said to make her husband leave? How could she figure out what was being said? Was it 'flash back' or flash forward' or 'flash sideways'? Why was Costello dying? Why did the story take the audience through the back door (again) to find us at the beginning? Did this happen? Was it going to happen? Did one of the last lines allow us to think that maybe the end results that have been seen will be changed? As for the production: Why were the interiors so dark? To save money. Go NFN whenever possible, right? There are several more questions to ask, but I do not want to actually ask direct questions that no one will answer of this movie. I do not know what movie the other people who commented were watching on this site (and a few others), but the one we just watched is far from being Oscar material as one person mentioned. The idea of the visitor Well, I suppose it was an easy way to communicate to the persons portrayed, but come on,really? Did the writers answer any questions? No. There is a whole lot more, but I can easily state (and without reserve), I would rather have watched Gravity again. I mean no disrespect to the actors. It should have started and finished. The script was created middle  present  middle  present. The comments of those few people who saw the movie today were walking out saying huh? There was a chance at the first few scenes to make this a gripping idea. Then...well, we were all inked!"
3,"I've never seen a movie so tedious and suspenseful at the same time with such a letdown in the end. Although the acting was superb, unless you like art for art's sake, don't bother with this one. The critics really got this one wrong. It won't answer most of the questions you'll come up with while watching it, including the one that makes the whole story unnecessary: just learn their language the same way your children learn English. Duh!"
6,"I went to see this because when I arrived at the theatre Arrival was the only movie that just started. I liked Jeremy Renner in other movies like The Town, so I thought I would watch this one. I was pretty disappointed and could not give more than a 6. It seems he did not get enough acting in and even looked quiet at times like his lines were cut out. I don't see him in a romantic role either and the music was too overwhelming for me. It is an interesting idea but I don't believe the writing was really there, her flashbacks were predictable, and you knew what was going to happen. One of those films basically you know as the ones that rely on the CGI to get the ticket sales which is a losing concept to me."

6,"The aliens have returned. This time in cool-looking, mysterious crafts that hover above the earth in 12 places. Amy Adams is the expert linguist (with a troubled past?) who's brought in to try to establish communications with the mysterious creatures. This film's concepts for otherworldly design are intriguing, but after seeing the film, the reason for their visit is still hazy. While there's lots of enticing set up, the proceedings move slowly to a repetitive and frustrating crawl before it's over. To make matters worse, the ending may leave you flummoxed. (Some internet research helped explain it.) While the premise is certainly fascinating, the dwindling pace and lack of much tension results in a less-than-satisfying outcome to this untraditional extraterrestrial narrative."
6,"Arrival is one of those movies where people think that if you did not think it is a great movie, then it means you did not understand it. The payoff at the end was just barely enough to cover the deficiencies. Getting to the end was difficult. It was super slow. The romance seemed forced. Could have been better. 6/10."

2,"I attended this movie with a friend and we were looking forward to seeing it.  When it was over we both looked at each other and asked 'what was that movie about ?  The flashbacks to her child and the confusion of future and past events made us spend more time trying to figure the scripts meaning.  We could not understand the complexity of the movie and what turned the evening into a chaotic movie was truly disappointing and hours later we were still trying to figure it out.  If it could have been less entangled with the past, present and future it would have been wonderful.  It was a waste of hard earned money."

The slow unraveling mystery is good.  The conventions of the sub-genre that still aren't transcended here are not, nor is some of the sentimentality.  Alas it is not that bold after all.Would a real scientist constantly dealing in mathematics and numbers upon reading .083 say, 'point oh eight three' and not 'point zero eight three'?  If he is played by a sloppy actor taking sloppy direction perhaps.  Or such a real scientist saying oh instead of zero might just need to be fired and lose grants."

3,"I don't get all the praise heaped on this movie. Maybe if I knew more of what to expect going in, because I expected sci fi/thriller type along the lines of Prometheus and Interstellar. While this movie starts out very promising with a lot of intrigue about the alien visitors, it soon drags, devolving into a commentary on human existence that really isn't emotionally moving or anything. There is a twist to the movie that was mildly interesting but seemed very copy cat of Interstellar, and then it ended very abruptly. I hated the ending. Basically there was no explanation of the reasoning behind anything and you are left hanging. It's just supposed to make you appreciate your humanity and question your life choices I guess.The one positive though is the acting throughout is superb. Even the dialogue is fine, just the pacing and ending are awful."

Love the director, cut my teeth on sci fi. Still, I'd have been better off staying home and bingeing on The Crown."
5,"The film starts off in an interesting way.  An alien race lands in 12 places on earth for an unknown reason.  Amy Adams is a linguist who is contacted by the military to communicate with the aliens, with a metallic, spider-like appearance, who communicate through circles of ink.  The effort to communicate with the aliens is the most interesting part of this film.  However, there is a major digression into the private life of Adams' character, and the film goes back and forth over time regarding the daughter's life (who is in the hospital in one scene) - her husband barely appears.  The movie is basically unsatisfying and confusing - you never really understand why the aliens came to earth in the first place and why they landed in 12 locations.  With the exception of Adams' character, you never really get to know anyone else.  There also doesn't seem to be any interactions with people at the other locations.  'Contact' was a much better and coherent movie on a similar subject."

6,"I feel like this movie has a few interesting ideas and a lot of wasted potential. Why someone would be bored by it is beyond me (unless you can't stand movies with less than 3 explosions per second). My main problems with 'Arrival' were the amount of clichs inbetween the good parts (the alien communication aspect) and the plot twist that wasn't really fleshed out. A lot of people would disagree with me on this, but I think if the movie was an hour longer or so, a lot more depth and character-development could have been put into it. I understand something with the length and pacing of, lets say Solaris (1972), would be unbearable for a mainstream audience, but I think it would make this movie better. It is nice to see a female lead in a mainstream movie for a change and Amy Adams does a good job. In the end, I think 'Arrival' is a well shot, well acted movie with some interesting ideas that's bothered by its short duration and its clichs."

IE, the uniforms, equipment and lingo is mercifully accurate, allowing you to enjoy the movie instead of getting caught up on the stupid stuff.  It isn't a military movie, it is a movie with the military in it, presented accurately.Civilians might scoff at the idea of upping a film's score for this fact, but you can't fully appreciate how bad of a job Hollywood does with what should be an easy task.  It truly isn't difficult or expensive to get these things right, which is why many of us are dumbfounded by the lack of effort in many other films.As to the movie its self, I think it was the best thing I've seen all year (2016).  The trailer didn't give the whole thing away, and it was built as a vehicle to deliver an idea, where each shot is composed using thought and care.  It isn't just people standing center frame reading their lines, interspersed with over the top VFX that fail to contribute to the story."

9,"ARRIVALTHE REVIEWScience Fiction with a brain. Its not common to have a movie like this anymore, there were few and far between lately. Sunshine, Midnight Special, Edge of Tomorrow are few movies that come to mind. Even the last one I mentioned is a big spectacle movie, it was still very smartly written. This movie deals with one of the most existential question of our time. What would happen, if aliens landed unexpectedly, not just in one spot but across the globe. How would we behave as species, both as regular people and as the governments in general. This movie manages to balance those questions and more, in this tense sci-fi drama.There are quite a few notable things about this movie, obviously the actors and Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner both give fantastic performances in which they enter this new reality both with what they know as a linguist and a scientist, but moreover as almost childlike wonder, as no one could prepare them for the exhilaration of the first contact, and what it means to them as just human beings. Both performances are subdued but there is enough tension that you just can't wait what happens next.Forest Whitaker plays a colonel that recruits Adams' and Renner's characters to help them communicate and ultimately translate the ultimate question that anyone who would get in contact with an alien species the first time would have: Why are you here. He plays a skeptic with an open mind (oxymoron I get it), but he lets them proceed with how they believe would be the best way to get to the final answers.Another big character in this movie is a music, which is very operatic, and with some could say somewhat religious overtones, which should have been detracting but actually adds the layer of suspense to the entire movie, and the aliens themselves. Direction in this movie is great, and that is very important in a movie like this. Mostly because it is not played out to be  shoot them up action blockbuster, Dennis Villeneuve of Sicario and Prisoners fame, finds a perfect balance where even the explanation part of the movie is very tense, and never boring. This is very important in this movie as they could become talky and go over the heads of people, with people losing interest and that's not what we here, its very well balanced.Overall the movie is a fantastic watch, and quite a break from all the big blockbusters of the summer, and shows that an alien encounter movie doesn't have to be all about big explosions or monuments falling, but actually be about finding out about ourselves as much as about the aliens.4 out of 4 stars"
10,"Arrival is basically the Michael Crichton version of a 'story by' Chris Nolan & Carl Sagan sort-of-remake of Close Encounters and/or Contact.  Villenueve is one of my favorite directors right now, and this makes it all the more awesome that he's helming Bladerunner 2049. It looks like some people are slamming this for not being big and loud (and dumb) like a Transformers movie, which is spot-on because Arrival is thankfully the complete opposite of those in nearly every way (and don't forget- as revered as Bladerunner is as one of the greatest, if not cult, sci-fi (and Ridley Scott movies for that matter) of all time, it tanked at the box office and isn't exactly paced like Raiders or Empire Strikes Back).  If you tried to watch Close Encounters recently, you might've found it to be a fairly tough watch for its insanely slow burn pace, but in its time it was riveting, thought-provoking, and powerful, which is essentially what Arrival pulls off for our modern age. And much like Contact, I don't see Arrival being the movie I rewatch as frequently as The Incredibles, the last 3 Mission Impossible movies, Fury Road, or any season of Game of Thrones or Hannibal, but man it's a fat-free, compelling as hell watch the first time around from beginning to end... though it won't hurt if don't go into it expecting Interstellar, The Martian, or Gravity.  Again, your 60-something favorite Uncle or under-30-something semi-millenials would probably be much happier watching Dr. Strange (which I kinda almost loved), Hacksaw Ridge, or Jack Reacher 2, but Arrival is clearly the one most likely to (hopefully) nab an Oscar nom."

10,"Without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Its suspenseful, atmospheric mood, along with its profound metaphysical message, heartfelt narrative and understated performances, combine to deliver one of the most impressive, thought-provoking pictures to come out in years. This edge-of-your-seat, edge-of-your-consciousness sci-fi thriller succeeds where predecessors like 'Interstellar,' 'Gravity' and '2010' failed. It left me awed and speechless, and, if you approach it with an open mind, it just may do the same to you."
7,"Dennis Villenueve proves that he's one of the best directors working today with Arrival. He creates an unsettling and mesmerizing atmosphere that keeps you at the edge of your seat, in good part thanks to brilliant sound mix and cinematography (it's arguably the most beautifully shot movie of 2016). However, it has a script that falls apart when you start thinking about it. The cast is okay, but they're stuck playing flat characters with little to no backstory. Despite the resonant themes and sense of mystery, you can only see scientists entering and exiting a UFO and throwing exposition so many times before it gets repetitive. The conflict is solved with a massive Deus Ex Machina, and everything ends in a surprisingly hokey note for a Villeneuve movie. It's worth watching in the theater because it works like gangbusters as a cinematic experience. But the story and characters didn't resonate with me as much as I would have liked to. Which is especially unfortunate considering it has its heart in the right place."
10,"Arrival is a truly excellent movie.It gets every element of filmmaking right. The script balances a strong scifi plot with an even stronger human story. I was so impressed with how riveting and cinematic the work of a linguist was made. The acting hits all the complex, layered notes just right as it tells a story that demands a lot of nuance from Amy Adams in particular. The cinematography and direction work so well in creating wide, haunting shots that make the characters feel small and vulnerable and then close, intimate shots that make us feel sympathetically claustrophobic. The music is haunting and memorable. The effects are stylish, subtle, and well-executed.My friend and I left the theater talking about so many elements of this movie and now, a week and a half later, I still haven't gotten sick of discussing it."

The story follows Dr. Louise Banks, a university professor who is called upon to help communicate with the aliens when they 'arrive' (pun intended) on Earth. She meets Ian Donnelly, who she begins growing close to as they work together to communicate with the aliens. The film introduced a really cool way of how the aliens speak and use language. The story continues to get more and more interesting as the characters unravel new information. Because of this the writing and direction were really great, especially how everything comes together in the ending. Casting Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner as the leads were solid choices, they both bring really great performances to their roles. I also really dug the musical score, it was haunting yet very unique and worked well. Arrival is a fantastic movie that is guaranteed to surprise and impress. Definitely don't miss it!"
7,"Arrival brings a somewhat unique spin to the overly done and cheesy typical alien plot. Visually, this movie has beautiful, yet simple shots that seem to abruptly change style throughout the movie. The writing was clever throughout, but at times is very corny and transparent.   Amy is absolutely amazing and singlehandedly swayed me to rate this movie at least a star higher."
10,"'Arrival', along with 'Hell or High Water' (2016) is one of the best movies of the year. Director, Denis Villeneuve ('Sicario'), this film brings in some uneasy tension and atmospheric moments that will keep you hooked through its 1 hour and 55 minute run-time. Amy Adams stars as Louise Banks, a linguist who is selected after twelve strange extraterrestrial spacecrafts have landed in 12 different parts of the world. What they plan on doing seems unclear to everyone, until Louise manages to find a way to make contact with these strange extraterrestrials. She is brought in by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) who informs her that she might be able to help communicate with these strange species. Along her journey, she also meets military astrophysicist, Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who remains to trust her the most when she is searching for answers. The movie creates this uneasy mix of tension and surprises, like most of Villeneuve's work, it is deliberately paced, but this makes room for some well crafted and carefully handled scenes that are pleasing to the eye. Our main character, Louise, seems emotionally distant from time to time, but we discover her backstory more and more as the film goes on. The sound editing is some of the best I've heard since 'Gravity' (2013), where anything that is loud is loud, and whenever the atmosphere is quiet, it is quiet and remains that way. There are no gimmicks or any unrealistic artificial sounds to make it an easy watch. Everything you see and hear is real. The movie should get Oscar consideration for its sound editing, not to mention that this might just be Villeneuve's best directorial work yet. He should receive a 'Best Director' nomination for his work here. If you love mysterious sci-fi with added tension, and even some occasional drama, with some of the best piece of filmmaking ever seen... you owe it to yourself to see 'Arrival'."
10,"When going to the movies tonight, I was afraid that I would be definitely let down due to my high expectations after watching all trailers, reading into the material and, of course, being quite the Denis Villeneuve appreciator. After walking out of the cinema with my significant other, both of us agreed that this was probably one of the best movies we had seen in a long time. The lack of unnecessary action, the brilliant story telling, the beautiful pictures combined with a much more than just suitable cast, made this film an amazing experience - and to round this up it send the audience into the night with a beautiful message - working together in desperate times for the greater good will always be the solution. L.K."
8,"I was not at all hopeful for this movie, there are too many below average alien movies (looking at you Independence Day) but I am most certainly glad to be proven wrong in this case. Such a refreshing take on alien invasion movies, thoroughly enjoyable. The story is excellently told, beautiful music, the visual effects for the aliens and their language are stunning. As always Amy Adams is terrific and it's been a long time since Jeremy Renner gave a performance that didn't make me want to punch him in the face. A definite recommendation."
10,"Having read the story on which the movie is based, I pretty much knew what to expect. I thought the treatment of the complex language issues at the heart of the story was excellent. I didn't mind the action inserted at the end of the movie, even though it wasn't in the original story. 10/10 for me."

9,"This is a deeply philosophical movie, so many parallels to life.   I thought it was ingenious and inspiring.When I watch a movie, I'm not watching it through a 'critical' eye, like what I like and don't like about the movie, but I'm weighing my own experience, my goal is always a vicarious experience.   I got that with Arrival.  I give the movie a solid 9.   I've only give a few movie a 10 in my life, so a 9 is really high for me."
9,"One of the best of the year so far.  This is one of the most engrossing films I've seen in years -- kept my eyes absolutely glued to the screen.  I had a few issues with the film lingering too much on the ending and not trusting the audience to figure out certain things, but as far as major sci-fi releases go, this is one of the greats."
10,"Arrival is, if you'll pardon the expression, one the best cinematic mindf*cks I have received in a while. It's a truly cerebral film, which might not be to everybody's taste. If you're looking for action/adventure Sci-Fi look elsewhere. If you are looking to be engaged, asked to think, pay attention, and read between the lines, you'll find this a plot worthy of your time and effort."
7,"Wow.Nice update metacritic. I saw this movie because of the director. Yes. He directed Sicario, one of my favorite movies ever. Back to arrival.There's a pretty big twist at the end.It's not on the level of say Bioshock Infinite or Spec Ops:The Line but it is new to my knowledge. My predictions were wrong as to what will be revealed or happen next. One of the best parts is when the aliens are revealed right as the Sicario(yep, similarity for those who are looking. Well listening) esque music blares up. You'll see some aliens almost as cool as the reapers. It's good sci-fi stuff and Amy Adams looks great. I guess that's about it. I could go deeper but nah(pronounced 'na' not 'noh') Too bad Denis isn't directing Solando. And Emily Blunt isn't in it! But then again, Benicio Del Toro's character can be captivating. 'Go ahead,finish your meal'"
10,"A superb, cerebral experience, with sublime cinematography and a storyline which is subtle, complex and captivating. This is an exceptional film, with performances that are both nuanced and powerful - Adams is brilliant - and the careful pacing coupled with a soundtrack that uses silence to enhance tension means that you're completely entranced throughout. This is not a fast paced action film, this is a masterfully crafted drama which I will be watching again. 9.97/10"
8,"Whats it about?Aliens make contact with Earth and Amy Adams is the only person who can speak their languageWhat did I think?An incredibly tense and engrossing film, Arrival subverts the traditional Sci-Fi blockbuster with a gorgeous mix of cinematography, direction, and really solid narrative. Add Amy Adams absolutely stunning performance and you have one of the best movies of 2016."
8,"It's definitely one of the more restrained and intelligent sci-fi films in recent memory, but nonetheless, this makes for a pretty compelling watch. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) ventures into the sci-fi territory quite seamlessly and Amy Adams is at the top of her game in this with some additional great supporting turns from Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker. The unique visuals and effects also served the film well. Really my only complaint is that I found myself a bit underwhelmed by the film's twist as it felt somewhat predictable and lacked much of an impact both on me and for the film. Overall, I absolutely wouldn't go as far as some have who claim that this is one of the best sci-fi films in years or even of all time but it still remains a solid and compelling film for the most part despite the twist not really doing much for me."

I was nearly in tears by the end. For those who say this is what Interstellar wished it could be, you're right. A beautiful, complex story. Amy Adams is fantastic.

0,"I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it a lot. It has a slow and building argument that finishes in a metaphysic meditation. All mixed in a context of international tensions and near-war situations. Just excellent!Even if it's different from Interstellar, it gave me the same sensations as a viewer. It isn't as slow as that movie though, but it's still not suited for every spectator. I heard some unhappy people after the movie talking it was boring. You must know if you are the kind of viewer willing to sit, relax and think a little with a movie."
10,"4.8/5. I'm glad I gave this a chance because I completely misjudged and underestimated this by trailers and can honestly say it's one of the most complexly beautiful films I've ever seen. I am completely in absolute awe of the sheer amazing intertwined emotional story that bends comprehension. The way this was executed from start to finish by Denis Villeneuve was near flawless and his message of love and peace was magnificently conveyed with glorious vision. He is definitely one of the greatest directors around right now. Adams and Renner were outstanding and the most fascinating aspect were the aliens obviously which you will have to see this to truly understand. Imagine the best elements from 'Contact' and 'Interstellar' and you'll get this mind blowing emotionally driven Sci/fi drama new age classic."
7,"Twelve mysterious UFOs appear on Earth and cunning linguist Louise, played by Amy Adams, is summoned to interpret the language of the beings on board. She is helped by Thelma (just kidding, it's Ian, played by Jeremy Renner). This film is great at creating suspense. It makes you really want to find out why these creatures decided to visit Earth and when you finally find out I think the payoff is really good."
9,"I truly enjoyed this movie. Everyone will take away a different meaning from this movie due to their own current life circumstances.The movie is well paced with the right level of tension and suspense building throughout, and the cast do a great job in portraying the scenario to the viewer.Ultimately, the movie is about language and meaning. The notion that we humankind are living on the brink of war day-to-day, due to the division of language, and yet we use language to bring meaning to our lives as well as using it to convey our humanity. This speaks on many levels and Villeneuve has managed to capture the essence and importance of language. The very same language that changed minds of millions of people to elect a new president. The same language that brings peace to millions worldwide through prayer. That same language that can be both beneficial and destructive to humanity."
9,"It is official. Denis Villeneuve is my favorite working director. This could change, but my Lord is Arrival brilliant. Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and now Arrival are all some of the best films of this decade - no, century - and each has an indelible respect for the audience. It trusts that we will follow along as Villeneuve spins a web that, though it may not make sense initially, will craft a gorgeous vignette of some element of existence. Arrival is most certainly a part of this collection now and is one of the best science fiction films in a while with stunning visuals, chill-inducing brilliance, and incredible performances.Admittedly, however, Arrival missed the mark for the first half or so. It seemed so different. So unique. Nothing truly made sense from the opening with this daughter that seems out of place for the film I expected to receive, plus the weird narration scene by Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). It just seemed so haphazardly put together that it seemed wholly indigestible. However, after this halfway point, the film is pure brilliance. Even better, it opens up the world of the first half to the point that you realize that - even if the narration is still a moment that I cannot wrap my head around -  everything else adds up. In this second half, Arrival soars with the grace and beauty previously only experienced by eagles.A confusing, nonlinear film, Arrival follows Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the country's best linguist in the aftermath of the arrival of extraterrestrials. In the interest of determining their purpose, Louise is tasked with cracking the code of the heptapods (the aliens). What transpires is film that can often mirror Dances with Wolves in its respect for language (Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well to a degree for this) and Contact for its similarities regarding the military and its approach to, again, language. In many respects, Arrival is a science fiction film, but it is also a film about destiny, free-will, and the beauty of language.Through language, worlds open up. One can weave a beautiful sentence that can move readers to tears. Others can craft a speech that sways people to believe one thing or the other. Language allows people to express feelings, emotions, thoughts, or simply converse with others. Language, as discussed in the film, is the foundation of a civilization. In many ways, it is the foundation of humanity. Arrival delves into this sheer beauty of language throughout the picture. Villeneuve brilliantly allows this elegance to take centerstage with long drawn out sequences of nothing but communication between Louise and the heptapods.Yet, the film hardly stops there. Through showing the possibilities the language of the heptapods can reveal, Arrival hits a peak. Once we learn that the heptapods language allows the speaker to see the future, Arrival's philosophical explorations really take hold. This is the part where many will be lost and why I am skeptical as to film's acceptance amongst general audiences. However, the film's nonlinear storytelling is incredibly revealing and really works. Through the nonlinear storytelling, we know the end of Louise's story. We do not know that we know this, but by the end, it is clear what her future is. Louise knows it and though she keeps it to herself in the present, we know the future is something that is simulatenously her past. It is already a part of her and one she cannot escape. However, it is clear she does not wish to escape her future. It is one filled with challenges, but filled with equal joy and love. Films have previously discussed the concepts of free-will and destiny (hell, Oedipus did this in the BC's) and yet, Arrival brings a warmth to the discussion. Though Louise may know her future, she chooses to head into it with no hesitation. Yes, it will bring her unspeakable pain and tragedy, but it will also bring sheer ecstasy. For Louise and many others, this is more than acceptable. However, Arrival does not hesitate to ask: If you know your future, would you try to change it? This is certainly a fallacy, as I believe Arrival showcases. The heptapods knew Louise's future. How? Because it already happened. There is no time, there is no free-will, there is only destiny. For the world of Arrival, the possibilities of the world are not endless. You are on a path and destined to complete this path.Arrival often mirrors the language it discusses, not just the heptapods' language, though. Language, as Louise states frequently, can be messy and confusing. Yet, it opens doors to the world that were previously locked tight. This is very similar to the film as a whole, as it is a complex puzzle and my initial hesitation to the film's world was because I only received small pieces of a large puzzle. Once they started fitting together and the image became clearer, the film became a truly awe-inspiring, striking, and beautiful experience."

Not sure if the best sci-fi in years but certainly the best of 2016. I can understand why critics would love this as it does not follow normal popcorn bucket plot lines. Good acting and wonderful cinematography will make sure you enjoy this film.
"
9,"I enjoy the movie. However, I could not help but thinking the theme has been repeatedly used for the past 2 months. Miss Peregrine, Doctor Strange, and now Arrival.I enjoy the way the movie is being shown with constant 'flashback' and it did set me up.As a research student, I understand the pain how the character Dr Bank has to deal with the military, it is pretty much what happens to scientists (to deal with politics, admin and such) on a daily basis.The deep philosophy behind the movie is also interesting as it demonstrates the conflicts within a human which comes into contact with 'new' things (and or world). In addition, because I am a bilingual from two very different cultures, Chinese and English. I understand the frustration of being an interpreter. And indeed, the more you understand the language and cultures of both sides, explaining a sentence or phenomenon to one side of people can be difficult because it takes time to think a way to translate the meaning and be able to deliver the concept which is indeed harder than you think. Because there is something more than the factual meaning on those words but the interpretation which is the key of a communication.(Let me give you an example below.)Back to the movie, note the general public is scared in such situation as they recall history and they are aware they are on the other side of civilisation, some of them would like to bring peace, some of them would like to fight them off.As a scientist, we are naturally curious, understanding of something new would be the greatest achievement of all, and hence explain how Louise and Ian approach the alien.I understand in most sci-fi movie, physicists are often involved as the part of movie since it involves paradox and time, but it would be nice to get an organic chemist role because it would be interesting for organic chemists to learn new organic molecules from alien if they exist.If anyone reading this comment and happen to know physics, could you tell me where can I learn more about time, event horizon, general relativity on a conceptual level coz I don't know much maths, thanks! Ok, the example of language and culture.For those who don't know Chinese, here is an example.One of Australian friends used to learn Chinese, he told me what he learnt. The first thing he learnt is 'How are you?' in Chinese which is fine.But here is the problem. Most Chinese do not greet with 'How are you?' Chinese ask all kind of questions from 'Where are you from?' (stranger/new friend) to 'How is your family/work?' (close friends/relatives)My understanding at that point is, there is no harm learning those phrases, but it is not particular helpful if you really want to interact with a Chinese. I quickly suggested I could teach him Chinese, but because there are tests and exams so I understand he would rather stick to whatever the teacher taught him.In contrast, for whose who do not know too much English, 'How are you?' is greeting, and they actually don't care how are you, it is in fact pretty meaningless.From my understanding, learning a language systematically (through a book/class) is quite ineffective. I argue the best way to learn a language is to interact with that person who is speaking in that particular language. Learning from items, to phrases, to sentences (like how a baby learn a language). And one day, your brain will 'click' and understand, like how Amy Adams understand a new language in the movie.I can tell you from my experience. I have learnt English for almost 20 years of my life, until I have interact Australians for an extensive period of time, I realise what I have learnt from my textbooks back from Hong Kong is virtually useless. Same thing if someone feel like learning Chinese, go interact with a Chinese, learn and practice and you will pick up the language and understand how they think fairly quickly."
0,"It's all too rare these days that studios partner with adept filmmakers with clear visions. Denis Villeneuve is one of those upper-tier directors whose previous works have ranged in genre and style, yet authenticity is central to their premises. This is his best film yet and comes at a time when, perhaps, we need it the most. My favorite film of 2016."
9,"So, if you take the cerebral elements from 'The Fifth Element', the time travel element from 'Interstellar' and parts from 'The Lathe of Heaven' you'll have something that closely resembles 'Arrival'. A very cerebral, thought-provoking movie with stellar acting by all the major characters. As a sci-fi buff, I indulge my guilt gigantic, transforming robot on robot mayhem as well as the deeper movies like this one. It is a solidly, suspenseful movie that has a surprise twist near the end. Go see it."

It's absolutely a jaw dropping experience. Tension building to its finest, great cinematography, great storytelling, great acting. Denis Villeneuve is impressing me more and more.
"
10,"This movie matters: an unmatched success at integrating emotional inner monologue narration and flashbacks, calmly spoken and seen, with relentlessly building life-or-death tension. Intriguing questions subtly drift into our consciousness as strikingly violent threats surround us--drenched in beauty and answered with mind. This film answers the question: is it still possible for a character's whole person, their existence, to be turned into a minute-to-minute crucial experience for the viewer? Yes, twelve times--Yes!"
8,"Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is a study of how humans communicate and attempt to understand each other. It examines human relationships that are endured through time, bringing into perspective the intricacies of our language and our interactions with something we don't understand. Only lastly is it a sci-fi movie about extraterrestrial life.Villeneuve has proved to be a director of utmost talent and diversity, but also the one that surrounds himself with equal talent, the Arrival being no different. Young's (Selma; A Most Violent Year) cinematography and style in depicting the research groups enter the mysterious ships produces some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi scenes that have ever been shot. The ships themselves look like timeless, shapeless monoliths. They defy the laws of physics and seem to have their own atmosphere inside. It is truly a grandiose, terrifying, unknown object. The Aliens inside those ships as well as the surroundings seem to raise more questions then answers, while the ships gloriously 'stand' on the backdrop of incredible landscapes, such as oceans, mountains and panoramic plains.Jhann Jhannsson is a long time favorite of Villeneuve, producing scores for Sicario and Prisoners. In Arrival his score elevates the scenes, adding tension utilizing mostly classical, timeless sounds. It is some of the best work Johann has done to date.Most importantly however Arrival brings a story that is original, beautifully ambitious and most surprisingly relatable and real. Real enough to believe that if this had happened tomorrow, the outcomes would not have been much different. It might however be that ambition that sometimes separates Arrival from being a true masterpiece.We witnesses the Arrival of the Alien ships through the eyes of a linguist professor, Dr. Louise Banks, convincingly played by Amy Adams. Louise is constantly haunted by a series of flashbacks depicting her daughter's life & early death. It is unknown how this is connected to the Arrival, but this relationship establishes the infrastructure for what Denis is possibly trying to convey, the pain and joy that language, time & communication bring.The aliens don't seem to be hostile; rather, they are trying to say something that a human can't translate. This is where Louise is required, trying to communicate with the aliens to understand the purpose of the arrival. However as the inability to understand grows, so do human frustrations, leading to inevitable disputes, wars and drastic actions.In Arrival we see China as the first country to decide to take actions against the aliens, with no apparent reason. In a comically ironic scene, we see the Chinese leader give the Aliens 24 hours to vacate before starting the attacks. Communications stall as all the research groups go offline, while Banks and her team race against time looking for answers.Some parts of the Arrival echo the Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers. There, Aliens have come and left, leaving behind mysterious 'zones' filled with objects that only 'Stalkers' dare to explore. The metaphor that humans perceive aliens similarly to how insects perceive humans & human objects, imagining a group of ants stumbling upon an abandoned roadside picnic, full of mysterious objects and sights.Yet the message of the Arrival is different. It originates from a kinder place, it projects the need for working together, for using language to try and understand others. In this sense the sci-fi aspect of Arrival can be seen almost as an allegory to say that as humans we owe it to each other to communicate more before taking actions, regardless of how painful the outcomes might be. I fear many will critique The Arrival for this 'kindness', for deviating from a more traditional resolution, but it's refreshing. That a director is able to portray an Alien arrival in such a rational, artistic and melancholic way is a tribute to his strength of character."
9,"This is good old fashioned cerebral, heady, thought-provoking science-fiction. It's also a somber picture; one that tries ambitiously to meld the heart with the mind. It mostly works, though in spite of what many are calling a formulaic plot (it's necessary, I think, and part of a larger theme).Amy Adams is basically herself but with the usual variations; this is her as stern, determined, soft-spoken thinker, broken or maybe always has been. It's a subtly engaging performance, the kind Adams has been doing great work with for a while now.The score is foreboding and ominous, fitting in not just with sci-fi history but also the kind of emotional tinkering Arrival plays with. Villenueve is a master of slow building suspense using striking and casual compositions in alternating rhythms.I wish Renner had been given more to do, more depth, more anything really. And I really wish the decoding of the language wasn't glossed over in a montage. It was built up as an incredibly complex and nearly impossible task, and then suddenly they had made really good progress with it. A few more minutes could have done wonders here."
8,"This is not an action movie.  It is also not a movie for those who want to have the plot and the main points spoon fed to them.  Amy Adams delivers another great performance.  Jeremy Renner is fine, but his character is really a fairly thankless supporting role.  The movie is likely over the heads of most people, as, at its core it is really a reinterpretation of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, which is a largely discredited linguistics theory.  If you know this going in (and I seriously doubt the majority of people do), it takes the main critique of that theory and makes it inapplicable as it is not being used to explain differences in human cognition based on language, but whether differences in alien and human cognition are based, in part, on language.  The other deeper issue explored is time.  Humans' existence is special and temporal.  For us, reality exists in linear time and we relate to the rest of the world in terms of three dimensional space.  What if there was an alien species for which time and space are not perceived the way we perceive them?  Again, these ideas are not simple and the movie does not successfully answer them.  But the fact that it even brings them up is more intellectually stimulating than most films I've ever seen.  Not that all movies need to be that intellectual.  I like other movies for other reasons.  But this is a smart movie that challenges viewers.  Again, it is not for everyone.  But I really liked it."
10,"From all of the excellent reviews and the enthralling trailers, I had incredibly high expectations for the movie Arrival as I was walking into my local theater. I left the theater almost on the verge of a panic attack with my expectations obliterated after the movie ended. Arrival was the most breathtaking and powerful films that I have ever seen, and I can honestly say that I have never had so strong of a reaction to a movie in my entire life. From the heartfelt cold open, to the appearance of 'Arrival' signaling the ending of the movie, I believe that it was as close as a film can come to being perfect. The emotional perfection of the movie's climax was almost too much for me to handle, and it brought out a reaction in myself that I've only experienced when reading books (mainly from Robin Hobb and PatrickRothfuss).It was a joy to see a true Hard Science-Fiction story on the big screen, and Denis Villeneuve has proved once again to be a masterful director. Every frame of this film is incredibly gorgeous, and I honestly don't know how some of it was filmed, as things that have to be CGI look so real. There is so much I could say about the movie, but I want to avoid any chance of spoilers. However, I will say that the  design of the aliens and their language was incredibly interesting, original, and beautiful. I loved how the creators of the movie embraced the fact that if we do ever meet any alien species, they are not going to look anything like us or immediately be able to communicate with Humanity. It's very interesting how the movie handles deciphering the Heptapod's language and teaching them our language, and while some could find these moments boring, for me they were engrossing. I wouldn't have minded even more scientific examination of linguistics and translating the language that bears no resemblance to anything created on Earth.This movie may not be for everyone, but depending on how it holds up after multiple viewings, I might have a new movie in my personal Top 10 Films of All Time. I highly recommend it, and if you want to see a video of my full review where I go into spoilers for the second half, it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ofAsrVZ6g"

The movie was provocative, makes you think, and has you asking questions afterwards.  This said, it's not a movie that is easily comprehensible, and can be easily forgettable with time.
"
10,"I went in not expecting much. Walked out very surprised and deep in thought. This is one of the shows that you need to watch very closely... or plan on seeing it 2 or three times. Kinda like Inception. I walked out and some people were saying, 'Did I miss something?' Fortunate for me, I got it right away... which is rare for me. Being a single, full time dad and going through my fair share of trials, this movie had me thinking and pondering for hours after. It really has you asking yourself the final question that Amy Adams asks Jeremy Renner at the end... which is really the point of this movie. There really isn't a poignant, relevant, thought provoking movie out there like this. It's truly one of a kind."
9,"Just a beautiful film from start to finish. Can't understand how anyone found it slow - I was riveted from start to finish, but then again I loved Tree of Life which Arrival reminded me of to some extent as well as Close Encounters, Contact, and The Day the Earth Stood Still (original)."
3,"Meh. No doubt adapting this material to the screen was challenging but the director's self-love really sucked the juice outta this. The too visually dark settings & blah blocking of action made it less than a pleasure to watch.This could have been a sweeping, magical visual treat but it just seemed to lack imagination. The score was often trite & overwhelming & the schmaltzy ending seemed to go on forever. Interesting story, but it could have been told with more humor, energy, tension, etc."

Arrival offers a vastly different experience than you usually get in the alien invasion genre. By replacing explosions and action with captivating dialogue and conversations, it gives us arguably the most intriguing film of 2016.
"
10,"Breathtaking, majestic, and yet still somehow grounded and real, 'Arrival' is an absolute monument of a film dedicated to the power of hard science-fiction storytelling and the human spirit as we understand it. High marks definitely go to Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker for their valid efforts in making this situation feel so authentic, but make no mistake, this is Amy Adams' film and her poignant, deeply moving performance is nothing short of career-defining. Also at the apex of this masterwork is director Denis Villeneuve, whose trademark penchant for tension and realism helps propel this film towards the stellar heights that it reaches. Truly, the best science-fiction film I've seen in years. Handedly."
8,"Congrats to the scriptwriter, director, and Amy Adams for making an extremely sentimental film that didnt make me want to throw up in my popcorn. Amy Adams is really quite amazing as she pulls off a role where she is part brains and part feeling  and she manages to make them mesh and make sense. Its almost a miracle. As usual, Villeneuve has made an original film that is also an interesting genre film with an excellent cast. Unless you only like blood and guts or only like real weepies, you should see this film."

Another Win for Denis Villeneuve. If you are complaining that this movie is too slow, then you have to get a life. Not every movie needs action to keep you entertained. This movie is smart and moving. Amy Adams kills it.

10,"Its rare that I give a film a 10 review; saying this I found no faults whatsoever in Arrival. Amy Adams beautifully plays Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor who is tasked in communicating with an American landed alien space craft. This film is beautifully directed, scored and acted and is brought to life by its original and compelling script."
6,"This could have been a great movie but the plot holes were large enough to drive a truck through and the premise is a bit hard to swallow. So there's a written language that induces clairvoyance. Sounds stupid when saying it out loud , right. So if the whole point was to teach us this written language, why didn't they start with that? Why was it Amy Adams who starts trying to communicate through writing? If they can see the future, why do they let one of themselves die? Forgetting the phone call to the Chinese general, a major plot point? Also, the twist is a bit predicable, not horribly, but you can guess it before the reveal. Poor execution has really detracted from this movie. If you're going to make a film, do it properly!"

Arrival is intelligent, dramatic, scary and heartfelt from beginning to end. The main character's quest to understand the mystery behind the alien's purpose is extremely engaging. With each twist and turn the film kept me begging to know more.

'Arrival' was an interesting, moving and very intelligent film, the plot was very good, and the exceptional development of Amy Adams was very correct and very passionate, this film is always loaded with emotions.

8,"Arrival is one of the rare movies of today that challenges the audience about what's happening and that's what I liked most about it. Smart, complex and meticulously crafted, Amy Adams strong and vulnerable performance lead Arrival to be one of the best movies of the year."
9,"Powerful! This movie is really powerful. I can understand some people might not like it because, for most part of the film, you have no idea of why some things are happening or being shown to the audience, but neither do the characters in the movie, it is like we are trying to solve the big puzzle about what the aliens are doing on Earth together. If you are like me, that is very engaging. I felt so immersed in the events of the movie that I did not see time passing. Then you finally starts to figure and it is awesome! Everything fits together very well! And of course, for the slow ones, they literally draw what is the answer of it all at some point... I loved it, and I must say that, because of the reviews and the trailer, I had tremendous expectations, and still I was not prepared for it this feature offers. Now, to be fair, there are a few things (nothing important for the story, just minor details) that kinda turn you off, such as lines by the scientists/academics that just reveal that those characters were written by people who don't really know how academics really are... However, these are just minor pieces that I could totally forgive at the end because it was so good! RECOMMENDATION FOR THE VIEWERS: don't look to much into what the movie is about, and avoid spoilers. I would not say that the twist is that surprising and mind blowing like the 6th Sense, but the experience of watching it as a blank page is very nice. Piece!"

I can't wait to see the Blade Runner sequel with Ryan Gosling =)"

Villenueve makes his own, ingenious version of a close encounter sci- fi adventure. The SFX does not hamper the story, supported by worth roles and a schivering score.

9,"So in my experiences living around the world, I have already come to theorize the concept this movie was based off on. I have for a long time thought about how language affects the way we think. This movie takes that theory to another level and will a little background and experience of linguistics I feel like I got a deeper understanding of this movie. Understanding the underlying concepts of this movie made it a lot more enjoyable. People compare it to Interstellar but this apples and oranges. I will say if you like and understand theories of spacetime you most likely enjoy Interstellar more, same can be said for SapirWhorf hypothesis."
10,"Such a beautiful, well-directed film.This director knows what he's doing and it shows.  Nearly every moment hits it's mark/purpose.Amy Adams shines and her genuine, unguarded loving was surprising and refreshing ... it taught me something new about acting (for example when she plays with her daughter near the start of the film).The science man isn't as good, but he's ok in terms of acting.  He's a bit distanced ... I can't really connect with him somehow ... I'm not really sure what he offers to the mission actually (it's mainly Amy who does it all).I was a bit irritated that they had a bird tweeting all the time, when what Amy Adams was trying to do was listen to the sounds the aliens made, so why have a bird tweeting away interfering with the noise?  Can't they get a species of bird that doesn't tweet, as their oxygen-monitor?I didn't really understand the bit where there was gunfire outside the alien ship, but I can look past that, as the rest of the film was so awesome.I loved the bit at the end where you see Amy rewarded for her work ... good on her.Beautiful low-key lighting sometimes in the defence base... beautiful directing and creative choices there.I like how they mainly hide the shape and look of the alien object until Amy actually ventures to it.Nice beautiful pacing ... I like how they immediately go into the ship soon upon landing.I would really like to congratulate the director"
9,"This was surprise at how good it was. I entered the movie thinking 'how could they make another alien encounter film and make it good?'. But they did! It had a fresh approach, keeping  within the behaviors you would expect from military and professionals, and then threw in great plot twists that reminded me of Nolan's Interstellar."
0,"As other have commented, Villeneuve is a good director but this is a step in the wrong direction for him. I hate to use the B word {boring}, but Arrival is a real endurance test even for fans of serious, thought provoking movies.qweqwedwqeqweqweqweasdasdasd"
9,"This is a very special film. A hugely unique take on first contact, Arrival is one of the most intense and cerebral experiences youve ever had at the movies, requiring full concentration, an open mind, and patience for a slow-moving, but utterly enthralling story. Featuring exceptional performances, astonishing directing from Denis Villeneuve, a near-perfect screenplay, and a mesmerising score, this is a truly exhilarating film to watch, and one that will leave you thinking and pondering long after the credits have rolled.First off then, suppose the most important thing to say about this film is that you have to have your brain turned on. This is not even in the same league as the likes of Independence Day or even Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, but is instead a dark, heavy-going drama that only uses a science-fiction setting to tell a gripping and emotionally powerful story about humanity.Much like all of Denis Villeneuves films, Arrival is at times a soul-destroying experience, portraying some utterly devastating forecasts of how people around the world would deal with first contact, but thats one of the reasons that its such an arresting watch.Villeneuve himself does an exceptional job at directing this film. Its the first massive-scale project weve seen from him, but his astonishing ability to create a stunningly eerie and tense atmosphere at every single moment in this film, whether it be in the unnerving sweeping shots of the alien spacecraft, or the smaller, more claustrophobic moments centring on the human characters efforts to deal with them, is testament to what a talent he is.And that tense eeriness carries over brilliantly into every other part of the film. For me, one of the most memorable elements of Arrival was the score by Jhann Jhannsson. Staying effectively silent for so much of the film, Jhannsson takes an incredibly unique and experimental approach to the music of the film, often making it appear as if it is sound coming from the real world.At times, the aliens cries and speech become pieces of musical score, adding significantly to the sense of danger and tension, which was stunning to see. At others, however, he uses some powerful instrumental tunes to heighten the drama of the characters emotions, and although this is a film in which you can hear the score, it plays such a significant role in shaping your experience that its a huge positive.Along with the music, the performances are another key element that make this film so stunningly intense. At the centre of it all is Amy Adams, who is astonishing from start to finish. Dealing with a very complex character and story, she brilliantly powers through and portrays a huge range of emotions, from her characters crushing depression early on in the film, to her determination and strength whilst attempting to communicate with the alien beings. Its not the normal Amy Adams we know and love so much, but a far more battle-hardened and intense performance, but that deviation from her more typical roles is spectacular to watch, making this easily one of her best ever performances.And finally, we come to the screenplay. Based on a short story, the writing here is an exceptional display of ingenuity and intelligence. The heavy-going and slow-paced nature of the movie becomes a virtue because of the writing, giving you as a viewer the time to think about everything that is going on and understand it deeper, whilst also taking on some incredibly complex ideas and themes and making them work almost perfectly in the context of a science-fiction film.In the end, however, this film isnt so much about the aliens as it is about its human characters. The story is very difficult to talk about without spoilers, however I can say that the way the films narrative unfolds throughout is genuinely one of the most unique and brilliant things Ive ever seen, and it makes for an astonishingly powerful development of emotions towards the finale. It does require an open mind, but with that comes a truly incredible and thought-provoking story.Overall, I was blown away by Arrival. A masterpiece of directing, scoring, acting and writing, its a truly exhilarating watch that will take you on a devastating rollercoaster of emotions, but with an ingenious and utterly enthralling story that you will not forget in a long time."
10,"One of the most beautiful movies made to date that effectively tells its story on time, humanity and the meaning of life. It can change a viewpoint and make you realise that each moment is worth living."
8,"Immediately we are grabbed from our seats into the journey of Dr. Louise Banks and her discovery of what it means to be bound by time. Played vulnerably by five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams (American Hustle, Doubt), Dr. Banks is weighed down in life by the loss of her daughter to cancer. While a sixth nomination for Adams is unlikely for this role, Arrival still gives a richly tense and starkly imaginative allegory to the coming end times, as paralleled by the inner demons of past trauma.In her present state, she is a college professor of English. At one of her teaching sessions, the lecture hall is suspiciously low on students. There are alerts on their mobile devices about unidentified objects landing across the globe, each one shaped like a large perpendicular shell. This causes for mass evacuation away from these objects, with only authorized authorities supervising and investigating what they are and where they come from. At this point, it feels like a rip-off of classic alien invasion thrillers including Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Day the Earth Stood Still. While it certainly obeys the tropes for the most part, creative liberties are still taken to ensure an exhilarating experience.Why did they land in these specific spots? Thats the question the American government is trying to answer as they conduct an organized approach to interacting to whatever thrives inside these things. Their solution in interacting with this unknown is to bring in Dr. Banks to apply her English knowledge, a highly discomforting task for her, as well as the audience. The unpredictability and danger that she is thrown into hits you right where you feel, especially when it comes time to approach the inside of this vessel.Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) proves yet again how much skill he has in disorienting you without having to manipulate the screen with IMAX magic, as his choices of framing gives an overwhelming feel of scale in comparison to this unidentified object. The color palette used by cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) gives a stark feel of loneliness in a world separated by language barriers. The stressful sound effects complement the sad melodic music scored by Jhann Jhannsson (Sicario, The Theory of Everything).Inside of the object, the gravity is perpendicular to our own; then at the end of the object, these eerie, faceless, squid-like lifeforms behind a white veil await the approach of human investigators. Dr. Banks leads the interaction with these beings, later named Heptapods, who communicate through painting abstract black rings that make up their language. So she, as a college professor, applies her history in English to vigorously study their language, which they call nonlinear orthography. The process in figuring out their form of communication is absolutely brilliant and inspirational in how its created and discovered.As real as this small-scale epic feels, its treatment towards the other countries is still rather problematic. Essentially, they are treated like outsiders from America whose first resort is to rage war against the unknown, unlike those in the richest country in the world who rely on communication past language barriers to solve problems. Based on what Ive seen in the news recently, this is not how things have played out.Theres also an issue I have with the portrayal of Dr. Banks daughter, who is absent for a large portion of the film as if shes not really that important to the story. If she were mentioned more consistently through the first and second acts, she would have strengthened the conflict between the key characters.Yet the reminder of our relation with family issues and the passage of time may just as well be the push forward that we need to communicate with one another despite the inconvenience of language differences across barriers. It is through interaction and compromise that we will arrive at where we intend to go."
3,"Very disappointing film.  I found that it was boring with no suspense.  I didn't care about characters or the aliens. It was not believable that Amy could not recognize that the symbol that the aliens were using was the same as  symbol on the book she had written."
10,"I am giving this a review of 10 just to offset the ones that feel that this movie is anything less than a 6.  I found the pacing at the beginning of the film to be very fast and also found the fleshing out of supporting characters to be a little thin(disclaimer, big fan of Donnie Yen), but this is a great popcorn muncher that tells the story of those who stole the DS plans. The critics are right when they say that the cg characters may take you out of it a bit, but you can forgive that considering the level of technology. This is a Star Wars story and you do feel good leaving the theatre."
9,"Really good movie. How the music theme blended in was the best part. Rarely you get movies where they show the real problems of an alien first contact.My friends don't like Sc- Fi movies at all, but I managed to get them in the cinema and, surprisingly, they loved it.Explaining even a tiny bit about it would just ruin it. I recommend to watch it without reading too much about it."
9,"Excellent movie! The jumps in time seem to make it somewhat hard to follow for some if I can go by reactions from some people in the theater. It's a lot better than I expected going in. This is probably the best take on really different aliens I've ever seen. I understand the hate from people who wished they could have left their brain at home and still be really entertained by your generic X-files aliens. Too bad for them it's a movie actually worth seeing."
5,"Weird and complex, strangely engrossing, but not entertaining.  A big problem was that you couldn't understand what they were saying half the time, but maybe that was a good thing.  And, as for meaning, who knows?  Certainly no 2001 or Close Encounters.  I suppose it had something to do with the meaning of life. Unfortunately, too much pat Hollywood story lines as well."
0,"Dont waste your time with this unnecessarily protracted pseudo-science-fiction drama about first-contact with aliens.  Instead, see 1977s Close Encounters of the Third Kind or even better the classic 1951 original, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.'"
9,"Well damn.I couldn't stop thinking about this one and may not for awhile. 'Arrival' is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've seen in this year. Everything about this film was just top notch that I can't put into words without going all over.So let put it like this:Amy Adams was wonderful in this. A very grounded and real performance. Probably her best. Same thing that can said about Jeremy Renner.And how the aliens were part of the story was fascinating and quite clever. Without spoiling anything, they had a unique look to them. Like spiders. Although out the film, you feel their presence. A presence that's both scary and yet remarkable.Denis Villeneuve is my favorite working director. He can release a movie every year and still be close of making a masterpiece. Villeneuve delivers a haunting and heartbreaking story that leaves the audience with a experience that will stay with them. A beautiful, thought-provoking, Sci-Fi film that isn't an action or war movie. And I'm even more excited to see 'Blade Runner 2049'.And how can I forgot the amazing score, astonishing cinematography, intelligent script, and the tearjerker ending that left me in pieces.I honestly can't say anything else. Please do yourself a favour and watch it. For now, I'm dumbfounded."
0,"The visuals and acting are great. And the initial interactions with the aliens were fascinating. Unfortunately, emotional flashbacks (forwards), which make little sense, are becoming a bit of a cliche for humanizing these kinds of movies. I wish these directors could accept that the geeky aspects are enough to sustain a kick-ass sci-fi movie (if done well). What next: faster-than-light travel powered by a mother's love for her child?"
9,"Who: Amy Adams, Hawkeye, and someone who agreed to be in Taken 3 as, Colonel WebberWhat: Another phenomenal addition by Denis Villeneuve that makes me wonder, is he the best director of this century? Where: Earth. I wanna say...Scotland? When (Can I watch this again): Arrival will be a sci-fi gem you can watch over and over again.  Why: If you loved the unrelenting suspense of 'Prisoners' and the feeling of utter futility 'Sicario' shoved down your throat, then this film will blow your mind in a completely different way from his previous films."
10,"This movie was totally meant for me! 'Time' is the most important thing to me and this movie hit it on the spot!!  People who are giving this movie a 5 or less is because they want a sci-fi to be action packed like Guardians of Galaxy or Transformer.  THIS IS NOT IT!!  This is an adult movie who is looking for more thought provoking ideas and understanding.  The people who gave it low scores did NOT understand the premise of the movie...  Also, people who felt it wasted their time obviously missed the entire movie! I am giving it a perfect 10 because it had all of the elements of a great movie - DEEP STORY, PLOT, Character development, and etc.  People think slow equates to no action.  Action does not mean fast.  Because you can have a lot of action but it can be a really slow movie.   People who are looking for some Interstellar, Transformer, or some Alien gun slinging movie this is NOT it! If people are looking for a real story, love, and understanding of how time. This is a must see movie of the year!!  Amazing as a my girl said this movie was meant for me!"
9,"Thoughtful. Eric Heisserer follows the classic formula of a script (adapted, this time) from a personal story with something bigger, but in that case works because of the nonlinear puzzle of history. Moreover, Villeneuve (Director) directs the film masterfully, Bradford Young (cinematographer) delivers an excellent job, and Amy Adams is fantastic in the skin of Dr. Louise Banks"
10,"Looking back, Arrival will certainly be one of the best movies of 2016. As a sci-fi flick it fascinates with its focus on humans instead of aliens, with the meta-theme of communication. Villeneuve also combines the content with his cinematic devices of narration. Finally, it is impressive to realize how much this movie is thought through as a whole."
10,"What initially seems like a sci-fi film about an alien takeover is really the starting point to explore deep themes of unification, connection, and the unique emotional experiences that bridges us as humans beings which transcend time and space. A beautiful, moving, and complex exploration of nearly spiritual themes of the human experience. The aliens are really just a way in but it's less about them and more about us. Great movie. Loved it!"

7,"Its the end of the world as we know it! A much discussed and sometimes feared story has come true which, honestly, always sounded a bit ridiculous to actually happen in the real world.I am, of course, talking about this new sci-fi drama Arrival where mankind is greeted by huge alien spaceships in the sky who seem to be coming in peace wait, did you think I was referring to Trump becoming the next leader of the free world?But yeah, these two events have a very similar plot summary so its only fitting that I had the chance to experience them in the very same morning.Directed by Denis Villeneuve  the man behind Prisoners, mindbending Enemy with Jake Gyllenhaal, Sicario and currently filming Blade Runner sequel , one could expect Arrival to be a thinking persons sci-fi. And one is not wrong.It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills. If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolans Interstellar crossed with Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life. Robert Zemeckiss Contact (1997) would not be very far either, because Arrival also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste.I havent read the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang that Arrival is based on. Wikipedia says that the major themes explored are determinism, language and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which sounds mighty dry and mostly sci-fi geek friendly. So its nice to witness movie makers adding some mainstream appeal which comes mostly in the form of Amy Adamss great performance. She truly holds the movie together as a woman going where no-one has ever gone before. You will believe her hesitations, the tears, and also the silent determination when the going gets tough. This kind of role is tricky because of the need to play it out mostly alone, often in close-up where every detail and tone has to be clearly seen and felt. Think Matthew McConaughey's mighty turn in Interstellar but decidedly less showoffish.So its mostly Adamss one-woman-show, and a quite rare chance to see her doing something memorable and worthwhile on screen. She accepts too many decorative pretty girl roles, even in more ambitious projects. The all-male supporting cast is good too, especially star players such as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. As stated above, I dont know the original story but 'Arrival's' message is rather spiritual and not 'dry' at all. Essentially it is a reminder that mankinds future depends heavily on our ability to understand and connect to the world, rather than attacking and overpowering everything we find foreign or downright alien. Its a call to rise above the inflexible ego-based mind the western society so dearly values, and to find balance with our intuitive side.Overall, Arrival is a good movie although I wasnt especially happy with the final act which seemed rushed. It felt like somebody grew impatient near the end and wanted to add something impressive just in case the people were not happy with this slow-moving tale. I do not want to talk about it here in detail but, for me, it lessened some of the movies overall impact. Mostly because there was not enough time to play it out as properly as the stuff that had come before.But yeah, if you are into more intelligent sci-fi and dont prioritize explosions, Arrival is good to go."
5,"Lets starts honestI really liked Arrival. Until it turned weird. Then, not so much anymore.With a class A cast including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker this should have been a great movie all the way to the end. Except that it wasnt. It was a great movie until it stopped being that. I had high hopes for it and as such I was left slightly disappointed.Arrival is a good story with a ton of potential for greatness until it got whacked on the head and it all went belly up. For some reason I cant help comparing it to the 1997 movie Contact, starring the iconic Jodie Foster, which kind of had the same problem. Great movie with a great story until the moment it went all pear shaped.The StoryTwelve pods of unknown makeup and origin have appeared overnight at seemingly random locations around the globe. As to be expected the media goes nuts and social services break down. School is out. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a successful linguistics professor who stands in from of an empty class room the next day. She highly regarded in her field and has done highly classified consultancy work for the government in the past. Because of this it comes as no big surprise when she gets approached by the military. They need her help in decoding the language of the aliens and once that is done they want her to establish communications with the visitors. For this mission she gets a team of people and works closely together with Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist, portrayed by Jeremy Renner.All twelve pods have positioned themselves at seemingly arbitrary coordinates all over the world. The local governments are scrambling to establish contact with the aliens and try to learn as much as they can about their pods. They all have a fall out about how to proceed and one by one they end up shutting down communication with the rest of the world. Everyone is now acting isolated without knowing what the others are doing or how far they are with their work to decipher the purpose of the visit. This of course creates an explosive situation that threatens to get out of hand when gossip has it that the Chinese are contemplating to nuke their pod in search for answers. This of course is not an ideal situation for anyone, as no one knows if and how the aliens or the neighbours, for that matter, will retaliate.Here is where it went wrongIn between her work Louise has these strange flashbacks to her family, mainly her daughter. Except that we learn she doesnt have a family nor a daughter. These flashbacks are just that, but that the events have not actually happened yet. They will happen in the future. And that, because she now speaks the aliens language, time doesnt follow in a straight line for her anymore but in parallel strings all mixed up.Say what?This is where is turned south for me. I am good with weird and strange. But that was too much for me. In that moment the movie lost its credibility in my eyes. I know there are concepts out there about time and space and astro physics. In fact I am very interest in the subject. I have read several read books and listened to countless podcasts about it. But the way it was done in the movie is just ridiculous. I am very sorry.Final thoughtsI suppose we can draw similarities to todays society, which is rather trigger happy. We constantly on the cusp of a global catastrophe even without the presence of aliens. This raises the question of what will it take for humankind to step back from the abyss. What is needed for people to start working together instead of against each other?Arrival also touches on another question. A moral one that people ask themselves daily. If you knew the future and the way your life would turn out to be, would you change anything? If you knew that by accepting the greatest gift and joy you would ever get, you would also set yourself up the the most desperate pain. Would you still chose the same path?Its a powerful message. I just wish they would have found a different way to convey it."
9,"This movie feels like a giant metaphor for communication and language and how each of those changes and affects all of our lives. I really enjoyed this film (especially the ending), and if I had to name any problems, it would probably be some of the editing (they don't change a shot for more than fifteen seconds and it does not feel justified at all) and some tonal issues."

Great cientific movie, makes you think.The plot and the alien stuff is really well run. Discusses very interesting scientific and philosophical topics and also has background message.
"
4,"Arrival has some interesting things going for it. However the plot quickly slows to a snails pace with the 'flashbacks' going on which caused me more than once to serious consider leaving the movie. The twist at the end helps some but even that they bang you over the head with like we are idiots and need everything spelled out for us several times."
8,"Suspenseful action movie. The 3D quality was lacking a bit (near objects were a little bit blurred) and the caption was sometimes double. I think that was a problem of the cinema, though.I didn't play the computer game but was positively surprised of this movie."
9,"I was totally hyped until I've read the first critics reviews and was really scared to be disappointed. After the first user opinions I was a bit calmed down but now after watching the movie...Oh my god, this was so good!!! They nailed it almost totally and I enjoyed it so much. While the credits where rolling I just wanted to start from the beginning again. They really captured the heart of the game and managed to bring it to a bigger audience.I already love the Resident Evil Movies but can admit, that they do not have the same feeling like the games and are just random actioners. But the Assassin's Creed Movie, really felt like the game and also like a big movie.If you love the franchise, go ahead and enjoy the movie."

But this movie is a great improvement and adds a lot of stuff to the lore. Many will disagree but for me this is the first succesful video game adaptation.The best of the movie are without doubt the scenes in the past and Michael Fassbender as both Aguilar and Lynch. The worst may have been the ending, it looked a bit rushy. For the next one they should make it longer and with more blood, two things that a game like Assassin's Creed deserves on the big screen."

10,"For those of us who actually played the game, this movie captures the essence of the video game completely! if you were expecting for the movie to start at the very beginning, especially after playing the game, then you will be disappointed, and there would really be no point in watching the movie! It has been 13 years since I exited a movie, in like fashion of the movie just watched, but I had to take a small leap of faith, more than half way up the movie theater, to show my admiration of this movie! I personally give full marks to everyone who contributed to this movie! Also if you are expecting over 60-120 hrs of gameplay to be implimented in a 2 hour movie, then you are just being stupid!I, for one, envy Mr. Fassbender's role!"
10,"I almost didn't see this movie after seeing the negative critic reviews, however, better logic won me over as I have played the games and loved them. This movie was awesome for a person who knows setting and what is going on, I believe Ubisoft tailored this game towards the fans and not newcomers and in that they did an amazing job. I am left wanting to go see this movie again, Fassbender and his supporting cast played the hell out of their roles. I thought the revamped version of the 'Animus' looked stupid in the previews and was very surprised it didn't bother me while watching and it in fact grew on me as I started to understand the change more. I loved the visuals and the setting. All that being said I believe the main cause for the bad reviews from some is the fact that they have not played the games and do not know the world, followed by Ubisoft shoving information from a game that lasts anywhere from 8-30 hours and has time to explain into a 2 hour movie and that may have confused some.The character development was there and maybe some are used to long drawn out explanations that would have been considered boring in an awesome action flick like this, I felt I knew each characters role and where they were coming from.I would implore anyone interested to give it a chance and go see it if you are a fan of the games or just really like a good action movie, its worth the time and money....which is surprising for a video game adaptation"
10,"Michael Fassbender is a good actor who can carry a franchise, and the film serves as a compelling origin story for Sophia Rikkin, as well as Callum Lynch. Clumsy exposition doesnt ruin a film that has a strong visual identity, fantastic action sequences and characters that Im ready to spend more time with already."

I can say from an unbiased point of view this movie actually had my heart pounding almost the entire film simply for how well it was crafted. The film was visually stunning, acting was sublime, cinematography ground breaking and original. These attributes are impressive alone even if you disregard the important political message laced through the film (I was not expecting that!). I guess the same people who gave this a 10/100 probably voted a 100 for bland, brain-sludge films like the new ghostbusters. How unfortunate there are so many uneducated people out there with the mental retention for nothing. This was truly a masterpiece."
9,"DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE HATE GUYS!! READ PLZ.I've come all the way from the mystic land of IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to spread the truth of this movie as a person who has actually played the games. Kinda goes to show how frustrated I am about this injustice...As a lover of the Assassin's Creed universe, I find this a really enjoyable movie. I really don't understand all the hate. Maybe it's because people expect something bad and end up seeing only the flaws, especially since video game movies are usually really bad. I love how they depicted the life of modern day assassins; it fleshed it out very well, and it showed without hesitation what the Creed is about. The scenery is beautiful; the animus (though different) provides an immersion I appreciate; the fighting scenes are very similar to the combat experienced in the games (the climbing too! which is AWESOME); the ending makes sense if you've played the games. I admit that there are flaws like the movie focusing a lot more on the modern assassins rather than the ancestral ones (the games focus more on the ancestors if ya didn't know), but they are understandable changes considering the new audience. I think it would've been a little better with me if they treated the movie like another Assassin's Creed game. So basically, to a newcomer into the Assassin's Creed world, they will either get confused and hate the movie because they don't understand it, or they will experience it like one of Marvel's superhero movies, but with a strange emptiness similar to that of Ex Machina. For people who have played the games and don't enjoy it just for the thrills, I think you'll be very surprised at what the movie accomplished. I know I was.Kinda funny how the movie's like 'We work in the darkenss to serve the light' and that's exactly what it's doing in real life. Just goes to show what a good movie it is. xDP.S. Totes buying this movie, bro. Gonna show my friends the light in the darkness. :D"
10,"I went in with low expectations, but was amazed at the end. The acting was top-notch, the action scenes were phenomenal, and the story was great. Assassin's Creed fans and people who've never played the game will enjoy this movie thoroughly. 10/10 recommend."
10,"I found this movie to be a very enjoyable experience. I found the characters interesting, the fighting had a flow to it, and the lore was true to the games. I went in with high expectations, and was not disappointed. Considering seeing it again in theaters."
8,"Seeing this through the eyes of a gamer who has played almost all of the AC games, I have to say, this checks so many of the boxes I wanted it to check. It's a love letter to the source material, and a treat for the fans, but, I can only assume, a confusing mess for others.Me? I found it difficult to wipe the big fat smile off my face while Callum / Aguilar is racing through buildings, on rooftops, killing guards left and right before doing a Leap of Faith. All of the action is so well done and shot, full of practical effects and stunts, and a spectacular, fast paced style, reminiscent of the games themselves.Now, I am not an idiot. This is a flawed movie, especially when it comes to its convoluted, disappointing story. There's no real stakes, there's no real enemy, just a very silly chase for an 'apple', and characters - whether Templars or Assassins - you never end up caring about. And it's a shame - the games provide a great framework in which thousands of different stories can be told. I wish they crafted a better one.But, in the end, what got me was everything else. The breathtaking action. The incredible cinematography. All the winks to fans. The weirdness of it all, an expensive weirdness the likes Hollywood has never seen before. (Seriously, name me another movie with a budget as high as this one that is so unconcerned with being mainstream).Also, props to Justin Kurzel and his DP, Adam Arkapaw. After crafting the most beautiful 'Macbeth' ever put on film, here they go again, proving they are among the most interesting visual filmmakers of these recent years."

8,"I am a fan of the game series and a fan of the movie. This seems to be another movie to not trust the critics reviews. They are always looking for something overly artsy, like The Witch, and can't just like something for what it is. Is it an Oscar winning life changing movie? No. It does the games justice while tweaking a few things.If you enjoy Assassin's Creed game series you will most likely enjoy this movie and will look forward to a sequel."
7,"Don't listen to the critics. This movie isn't as bad as they are saying it is. It still has some problems and if you played the games, you will already know the plot twists and see them coming from a mile away. However if you didn't play the games, then you will probably get lots of enjoyment out of it as well. I went and saw it with a person who never heard of the games and they still understood it and enjoyed it a lot. And while this movie shares a similar plot to the games, it is not accurate to the games at all. This movie is it's own thing, and I appreciate that. They made the game's main plot points and ideas work in movie form, but they didn't go all out and copy the games. As a result this will feel different to the games, but I still enjoyed it. Overall, it was a pretty decent movie."
7,"Assassin's Creed doesn't offer a solid, well written plot. Fortunately the core of the movie is not about the plot and doesn't overexert in trying to explain itself. It focuses and makes the most out of what the AC franchise is known for: amazing acrobatic moves and combat, exotic setting and the mystery surrounding the assassins. In addition, with the movie played by excellent actors (Fassbender and Cotillard) who take their role seriously, Assassin's Creed the movie holds its ground against any other box office movies."
8,"This is a film adaptation that is aimed towards those who have a significant amount of knowledge of Assassin's Creed. Those who haven't played the games won't understand what this movie is all about and what it's going for.Also, to those saying that most of it should be set in the past and not the present, do you really think making 99% of the film in the Spanish Inquisition and just having short five minute scenes in Abstergo would translate well into a movie? After all, it wouldn't be Assassin's Creed without the Animus and First Civilization lore, that's what make up Assassin's Creed, it's not just the hoods and hidden blades. I'm glad this stays true to its source material. It didn't shy away from the games deep and complex story."

7,"I thought this movie was a fine made film for Assassin's Creed fans and audiences that want a decent action flick. There were a few problems with it but I believe my money was well spent.Story - The movie is set in the same world of the video games on 2016. The main Protagonist is Callum Lynch that has connections with the Assassin Order that has been at war with the Templar's throughout centuries. Callum is forced to go onto the Animus, a machine that is programmed to relieve the subject ancestors memories through Genetic DNA. The lead of this project is Sophia Rikkin, a scientist that will lead Callum to one of the pieces of Eden known as the Apple of Eden for her order the Templars. One my person note I thought the story was thought out real well as it helped us connect Callums understanding of his purpose and the issues Sophia Rikkin was going through. The few problems with the story though is that the side characters introduced didn't have enough screen time to care and that the memories visited  during the Spanish Inquisition weren't long enough to care for the Assassin Agulair. Setting- One of the few best things of the film was that it recreated the lore of the Assassin's Creed into perfection. Everything I saw felt natural as if it was nostalgia. The color of the film too created a atmosphere basing on the scenes that were shown. Acting- The acting was done well enough to help the viewer be entertained though there were some flat acting from the few associates of Callums and the Abstergo employees.Overall the film was made well enough to make me entertained. It's not a film for everyone but I do recommend watching it to see for yourself if you like it or not. Some films don't deserve to be seen like After Earth but some other like this is deserved to be seen at least once."
10,"If you watched Jeremy Jahn's, Chris Stuckmann's, or Angry Joe's ReviewRead this!!!!!By coming to Metacritic I'm assuming some of you are gamers and want this movie to be good. Well fret no longer. I will explain my experience in detail without spoilers and why it is so good. So here goes. The reasons reviews were so low was because the storyline to the movie is NOT the same as the storyline to any game. That being said, this NEW story is not about Desmond, Ezio or any of the older characters in the Assassins Creed universe. However, it is about a new character called Callum Lynch (Cal) and his experiences in trying to help Abstergo in trying to find Ezio's Apple of Eden- and they do an excellent job (I actually even managed to hear claps from the audience by the end while walking out.) The fight scenes were excellent, and so were the Villains and the Abstergo workers that each created a nice atmosphere. The only problem I have is the title. It should not have been called 'Assassins Creed' because it was a new expansion to the universe. I would have rather preferred 'Assassins Creed: Callum and the Apple of Edan' because the first 5 minutes I was looking for Desmond and was confused.Regardless this did not ruin my experience and I would VERY much love for a sequel. Thank you and if you are a Gamer or an Assassins Creed Fan. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie :)"

10,"I've been a fan of AC since 2008 when i played the first game... by now i fully understand the story and narrative, and continuity of all these stories being all connected. The overwhelming aspect is the long ass war between Assassins and Templars and fighting for control of order and peace through First Civ tech called pieces of Eden. By the way, if you don't know anything about the games, books, and comic-books and lore of this series you may not enjoy the film. In my opinion, I loved this movie, it hits everything i like about the games (stealthy aspects/eavesdropping/the action & combat + hidden blades) and its very stunning, and visually entertaining! the atmosphere is well made! Top Notch Cinematographer, Adam Arkapaw, same dude that worked on Macbeth another Fassbender film! which Fassbender should get an award/nominated the best male performance, I loved his take on both characters Callum Lynch and Aguilar de Nerha. loved all the references and Easter eggs throughout the film!  Justin Kurzel did a fantastic job for the whole composition, i was surprised though that is was short of 2 hours, it really told the story in a fresh pace. THIS IS a video-game movie!10 out of 10 for me!"
7,"Assassin's Creed is by no means a perfect film. In places it falls flat, in other places it feels scared and lacks confidence in itself and the story overall isn't anything special or memorable. However, the cinematography, the costumes, the world that has been created is stunning. It feels like Assassin's Creed and does the games justice in that aspect. Several sequences in the film take your breath away with how action packed and bad ass they feel and the casting suits the film perfectly.    A lot of people were sceptical about the new animus and how that would work. But I must say it was brilliant, it translates perfectly to film and just makes the action sequences that much better. I would say that if you are an Assassin's Creed fan you will watch it and most probably enjoy it for what it is. A lot of people seemed to have jumped on the hate band wagon and not given it the reviews it deserves.    I would watch it again as I definitely enjoyed it and would even welcome a sequel. I think they tried to play it safe with this film and some of it paid off, some of it really didn't.At the end of the day, they had a hard job. They had to please the fans who know the games as well as pleasing people who are new to the Assassins Creed universe. Finding that balance is difficult and when you get torn between pleasing both parties you either end up with on screen magic, or a confusing and poorly explained couple of scenes. This film did both of the above."
9,"I dont understand why so many of these so-called official reviews carried such a negative narrative. As a player of Assassin's Creed, and as someone who has just watched the show, I thought the movie was pretty good.

8,"The Assassin's Creed movie stays true to the original game source and is everything a gamer has wanted in an Assassin's Creed movie. The Lore and mythology of the movie is like you see in the game and the movie while offering a different story line stays true to the lore.Even for the people who havn't played the game before, the movie does an excellent job of outlining the plot and explaining who both sides of this eternal struggle are. Very worth while seeing and looking forward to seeing where the franchise goes from here."

I am a huge AC fan and I was waiting for all the running in the rooftops, leap of faith and everything you can do in the game - and i got it. I agree story was full of holes - but i didnt mind it. As long as I can see 'Ezio' in real life doing his parkour things, i am happy ^^"

7,"j'ai trouv le film vraiment pas mal. il nous mne dans l'ambiance du premier assassin's creed (le jeux) et les labos abstergo sur le projet animus.comme pour Desmond, Fassbender est le sujet qui permettra aux templiers d'imposer leurs volonts.le film propose ce qui a fait le succs de cette IP et utilise tous ce qu'il peut pour mettre  l'aise les initis. je n'en dis pas plus.la plus part des scnes d'actions se passent dans l'animus, le pass (espagne 1492) et en espagnol sous titr, qui reprsentent bien plus d'1/4 du film...plus dans les 3/7 et prsente l'intrigue, les protagonistes dans le btiment d'abstergo de madrid. comme pour la trilogie Desmond, la pomme d'eden est l'objet convoit par les templiers.l'interprtation mcanique de l'animus n'est pas vraiment surprenante dans le sens ou l'acquisition des comptences du crdo s'apprennent pendant la synchronisation avec son anctre. dans l'ensemble, le film alterne le rythme de narration et essaye d'approfondir le contenu en peu de temps pour arriver aux moments que les spectateurs attendent le plus. le rendu est trs correct mais dans l'ensemble, les scnes manquent d'espace, car le cadrage manque d'envergure et les plans sont dans l'ensemble plutt serr. seul les interventions (trop nombreuses) du fameux rapace prsentent de jolies traveling.pour la bande son, je trouve qu'elle accompagne bien le film mais manque rellement d'identit  dfaut d'tre trs percutante.sinon, le film, est franchement pas mal, sans pour autant tre transcendant, mais j'ai bien retrouv l'me du jeux vido (premier du nom) qui m'avait emball  l'poque. rien n'est parfait, mais pour un premier essai, je trouve que UBI a russi l'exercice.suite au prochain numro."
8,"Well, I love the games, I liked the film. Yes, there is room for improvement, but still, it is a very good film. Truth be told, I went to the cinema with mixed feelings - quite frankly, I didn't like the idea of moving Animus, and the music in the trailer was terrible. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised. The moving Animus fits the film incredibly well. In a way it makes the training/improving skills of the descendant by Animus exposure much more believable. In my opinion, the film is more appreciated by those who know and play(ed) the games before. Why? For example, because my friend asked me after the end of the film: 'Why was the bird there all the time?' Well, how to answer that..."
8,"Not sure why these critics can't take a movie without much humor, but don't let those negative reviews dissuade you; this is one hell of an entertaining movie. It manages to be familiar enough to the game franchise so that fans of the games can enjoy it, and the movie proves welcoming enough to newcomers who have never played the games before so that they can enjoy it too. The story is presented in an easy-to-understand method, unlike Warcraft, and it's plot proves very intricate and interesting, like the games. This film is also filled with riveting, intense fight scenes, stellar acting, and a substantial plot that keeps you entertained. My only complaints stem from a few holes here and there, but overall, this is a step in the right direction for video game movies."

9,"In Alan Rikkins own words in the movie (or similar): 'Not my best work but everyone will understand what I mean.' It looks and feels like Assassin's Creed. Sometimes there are strange moments in the way how characters act because the movie is fast and full of things so that they can't really develop. Rikkins words fits there really well.But I can say that I enjoyed the movie and would love to see a sequel."
10,"Purists who expect the movie to be a 1-to-1 adaptation of the games, or a sequel to the series will be disappointed, it is not. However, it does a masterful job of condensing a universe created during five 80-hour-apiece games into a single 2.5 hour movie. This does mean the exposition needs to come quickly, but not overwhelmingly quickly.The plot is reminiscent of the first game, for the most part, but is split more evenly between the past and the present. While riveting, the effect comes not from suspense and unexpected twists, but more from the beautifully choreographed fight scenes of Aguilar's mission that cut back to the present to show the Animus's ethereal recreation of the memories as they play out. The possibility of sequels is left open, but all the immediate plot points are resolved, which makes the movie viable as an independent piece as well.Visuals play a big part in the movie, from the squalid slums and artistic castles of the past to the clean, technocratic Abstergo compound, they are all perfectly executed. CGI is there, naturally, but it fits the rest of the movie and is not jarring or out-of-place. If seen in 3D, the depth is natural and greatly aids immersion during the fight and escape sequences,The Animus and its execution deserves separate praise: though starkly different from the game's sleek, user-friendly device, the mechanical contraption moves with a fluidity that makes it look surprisingly graceful and fitting for the ethereal recreations of the protagonist's memories. Some might find the overlay sequences (where the Animus chamber is shown with the memories being projected) blurred and hard to see - I'll admit I had to focus as well, but I found the effect to be fitting for the ethereal nature of the memories, and on some level, the machine itself.The soundtrack does a great job of not being there overtly. There are intro and ending pieces ... and that seems to be it. During the movie, the entire score seems to be absent, it feels more like ambience than actual music being used to underpin the action.The combat scenes are what carry the movie: the choreographers captured the fighting style of the game's assassins faithfully, and succeeded where even many players did not - proper use of the iconic Hidden Blade. The graceful, acrobatic moves of the Assassins stand in stark contrast with the opponents' clumsy, brute-force approach; while during the escape sequences, the Assassins make full use of their environment, just as the games encourage the players, climbing, vaulting, and hopping with practiced grace.There is not much to be said for negatives. I DID miss the game's Eagle Vision (the Assassin equivalent of clairvoyance that allows them to discern their target and discover hidden patterns in the world around them), I hope we'll get to see its debut in the next movie. The Apple's power could have been expanded upon as well (it is used as a weapon and a tool several times in the games), but this is likely something that is reserved for a sequel.All in all, I would say that the film is an exceedingly well-done adaptation, not of a game series, but of a universe. The plot does not follow the pre-established story, but creates its own, and while somewhat exposition-heavy, the difference of duration between the originals and the film must be kept in mind.I would recommend it to anyone who likes action films or the game series without a second thought."
10,"The very low Critic reviews (not users) clearly show why metacritic is not to be taken seriously, i mean they even admit to not have played a single one of the games, and then critize the movie as 'non coherent plot'.. sure, when you dont unsderstand hundreds of hours of the source material, how can you expect to judge anything? This just shows these kind of 'certified critics' are a hoax, and should critize no more than their own bathroom loo (if they spend quality time with it, i mean)."
7,"This is a film tailor-made for hardcore Assassin's Creed fans. If you know nothing about the Assassin's Creed universe, you will end up with 100000 questions marks in your head while and after watching it. Everything core about the game is preserved. It feels like the first Assassin's Creed game very much. And by mentioning core I mean it is about the modern day story. The modern day story is the core please!!! The action is well-designed and my heart is jumping fast and my hands sweat a lot! Don't believe the critics 100%, see it for yourself after getting some background knowledge about the game before you watch it. The actors are quite good. Though I would like the film to dig more into the ancestor story as well as the conflicts between the core values of Assassins and Templars. More elaborations would be great. But this at least for me does not become a letdown because the story itself is already enough for a 2-hour length. Overall, the film has brought the game to life in the reality of 2016.

AC is violent and bloody and in the movie guys are getting there throats cut with no blood to show. The game is all about stealth where the movie was like 5 on 20 combat. The movie was more about Abstergo then actual Assassins. Especially disappointed because Michael Fassbender is awesome."

4,"So, just got done watching 'Assassin's Creed' and I went into this film hoping for the best as this was a video game to silver screen film. First I'll start off by saying, when you have a winning formula, why change it? Sure we have played the games, we know the stories, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't have loved to see a live action adaptation of the first game. Michael Fassbender, did a great job playing his character,  sure it's a little strange to see him speaking Spanish but hey whatever,  the guy has depth.  The film is set during the Spanish Inquisition and Fassbender plays Aguilar de Nerha a man who has lost his entire family and has pledged his life to the brotherhood of Assassin's to protect free will against the Templars.   The graphics were superb and the locations were beautifully designed with high amounts of detail. Choreography was horrific in most scenes and the acting skills of the no name, could care less about them, extra would be assassins was also laughable. They try to be intense and just come off as trying to hard.  Jeremy Irons plays the opposite part of our hero as Abstergo C.E.O.,  Dr. Rikken who is hell bent on pushing the limits of our hero to find 'the Apple of Eden' a relic from the Garden of Eden that contains the seed of the first act of disobedience against God in the Animus a machine designed by Dr. Rikken's daughter Sofia, played by the beautiful Marion Cotillard, who in this film seemed rather stiff in her role, a role and character that we don't get much information on, other than the fact that she has designed the animus and that she is trying to help rid the world of violence. If you are looking for any semblance of the Assassin's creed games that you enjoy, you will only find it in the, the armblades, the disappear into the crowd moves, the leap of faiths, the running on rooftops and the eagles that point out view points. Be prepared to be leaving this movie thinking,  'Wow, Mortal Kombat was better than this movie'. They couldn't even get the Animus right.-Admin Devin"
2,"If you can't agree that video game movies are (at least) bad in general, then you have to seriously look up a ton of reasons why they are expected to fail in critical reception.

Such drab and one-dimensional plotting/characters that the whole movie becomes a plot-hole for itself. A few nice setpieces though.Don't hold your breath for a sequel, this one isnt doing good at the box office. But hey 10/10 because videogames!"
5,"Assassins creed is a pretty straightforward franchise. Its about historical conflicts, and cool dudes that run around taking out major targets whilst doing awesome parkour. I'm not a huge fan of the games (I've only ever played IV) but as someone who is into history, I was pretty stoked for this movie. On top of that, Assassins Creed is also a reunion For Justin Kurzel, Michael Fassbender, and Marion Cotillard; who all worked on the most recent version of Macbeth, which I absolutely loved. My expectations for this movie were high. So high, in fact, that I disregarded the overwhelming onslaught of hate that came in the wake of the movie's early screenings. Boy, was I wrong.Justin Kurzel is a great director. He has a gift in his manipulation of fog, dust, and light. He did great things in Macbeth, especially with the final confrontation, and he does similarly great things here...at least when the screenplay permits it. The setting that I had most looked forward to; fifteenth century Spain, at the height of the inquisition, barely gets 30 minutes of screen time, if that. The ferocious beauty that Kurzel's visual style brings to the table is never given time to become the prepossessing masterpiece I know it could have become. The epic acrobatics, tense sequences of martial arts combat, and exotic weaponry scarcely sink in before the viewers, just like Callum Lynch, are jerked back to a monotone and boring laboratory, that serves as the setting for most of the movie.At one point in the film, when the villainous Templar priest finally lays his oppressive hands on the apple of Eden, the movie's sought after artifact, Aguilar, and his Assassin partner leap down into a cloud of grey smoke, emerging from the shadows here, and there, laying absolute waste to the Templar. This is a moment of cinematic triumph, and Kurzel ought to be pleased. Next however, as Aguilar seizes the priest, he looks across the room, and sees his partner just as she is murdered by a Templar enforcer. An epic duel ensues. Climactic combat is Fassbender's forte. The man shows his emotions so well with his facial expressions. This woman is his wife, presumably, or his lover perhaps. However, I have no idea who she is; heck, i don't even know what her name is. The movies plot prevents you from being emotionally invested in the most adrenaline pumping part of the story, because the script focuses on what has to be the most positively tedious plot device in Assassins Creed.This movie was Ubisoft's chance to disconnect the Assassins Creed franchise from the half-baked convoluted sci-fi plot devices that are part and parcel of the games. Instead, the film chooses to be a movie that is almost solely, a half baked-convoluted plot device, with a dash of fantastic stunt work on the side.I am usually pretty optimistic after a movie. It takes very little to please me. My rating scale tends to peak at 'perfect', and reach its low at 'just good'. I'm sad to say that I wanted Assassin's Creed to end. Once I realized that there were no more animus sequences coming my way, I had no reason to care anymore. This was not, sitting on the edge of my seat, or wishing the film would hurry up and get to the climax. I legitimately wanted the movie to be over, so the credits would roll, and I could get up and leave.Assassin's Creed is a tragedy. So much talent was involved, and clearly, plenty of hard work went into it. A few times, Kurzel's pictorial virtuosity is allowed to shine through the weary and trite plot, but for the most part, it is suppressed by how vapid and incomplete everything else is. It is a pity. Assassins Creed was chock full of potential, but it couldn't have fallen more short."

4,"The last movie by director Justin Kurzel was 'Macbeth', which marked him as an impressive visual stylist. His latest, based on the popular video games, still boasts impressive visuals, but lacks the narrative heft to make it work. Michael Fassbender plays the last descendant of the Assassins, a secret society that battles the Templars for an end to violence and mankind's free will. The simplistic plot is one that only a video game could spawn and it's inevitably peppered with lots of action. Kurzel has created dense imagery (with lots of dust and smoke) and his fights are high-energy, although ultimately repetitive and tiresome. The best thing that I can say about this film is that Fassbinder spends about 1/3 of it fighting and flexing shirtless."
3,"Like every movie based on a video game. They don't stick with the story, I mean sure they did that but if you expect more, you will surely be disappointed. Michael Fassbender does a good job in everything but please get better supporting actors because it was just lazy and sometimes awkward. Action sequences were pretty okay but the rest is just garbage."
0,"The worst movie that i've watched this year in my opinion. It is now a fact that every video game movie is cursed to be horrible. The CGI in this movie is horrible, the fight scenes are horrible, the plot is so inconsistent and hypocritical, the ending is forced for a sequel (not gonna happen!!!), the only redeeming quality is the good actors and 1 parkour scene. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE."

I love the games but I have to say this movie has the flaw that most of its series does. When its getting 'good' with assassin action you are ripped out of the fun to present time. I DONT WANT TO SEE PRESENT TIME.

2,"It's hilarious to read the positive user reviews on Metacritic.  At best, it's the worst movie you'll watch in a year and possibly the worst in a decade.  I don't expect much from a movie (I give 3-4 stars to movies that get 2 from others) but this was just ridiculous - a baby inside his/her mother's womb could have made a better movie than this.On the subject of good reviews, they talk about fight scenes but the fight scenes are actually horrible in this movie and turn Jason Bourne and Mission Impossible into Epic Bonanzas.  Same with Parkour scenes - there was one lame parkour scene that's worse than anything my son has done in AC2, Revelations, Black Flag, Unity and Syndicate. What on earth did they like?  They can't seriously have liked the Animus, they couldn't have liked the melody-less and unharmonious music, they couldn't have liked the story, the cinematography and editing were a mess of epic proportions (blur and fog have nothing to do with Assassin's Creed).  I get that they like the title and the game (so do I) but that does NOT make a good movie. Generally speaking the positive reviews center on monosyllabic epithets which are usually incorrectly spelt so if your appreciate the lamest badass Templar fight in history then by all means watch the movie and enjoy it... If you watch the movie, remember how ridiculous the main bad guy was.  You know nothing about him and you won't even have any recollection of seeing him fight or wielding his sword like a true swordmaster. I believe the director has hired all his family to dislike the negative reviews as he did in the movie.  The movie is such a tragedy that it turns Macbeth into Seinfeld.My son and I love the games.  Coming off the heels of Black Flag which we completed twice (on the Xbox and Xbox One) and the incredible Syndicate with its beautiful Victorian settings and music, we expected the movie to honor this series which merges fiction with historical figures and locations. First, the movie is a family affair (see below to learn how the director hired his wife and brother for pivotal parts in the movie).  Second, I don't believe the director has played the games and understands what sets Assassin's creed games apart from other games so there's no way he could make a movie worthy of the games.Unfortunately the movie was extremely disappointing and it's prompted me to write a review which I've never done before. The depth of the story is really low as is the character development.  Why is this important?  Because you need to 'connect' with the characters in any good movie.  You won't connect with the actors in the movie as you did with Ezio, Kenway, or Jacob and Evie Frye.  Many of the fight scenes are blurry and badly choreographed and that's such a big part of Assassin's Creed.  Like the movie, you are wondering what happened as opposed to thinking 'wow what an incredible move'.  The concept of the new animus is nice but they use it in every scene and it destroys any suspension of disbelief that the story is taking place in another timeline.  Every 10 seconds in a fight scene you come back to the original timeline and then go back.  It's like being taken out of London or Havana in the game to see the animus every minute...During the movie, my entire family wanted to leave because of the bombastic sound of the soundtrack.  Unfortunately, the director hired his brother (and his wife as an actress) and he couldn't come up with a decent score or a catchy melody so he blasts heavy metal music throughout 30%-40% of the movie even without action scenes.  Well, you simply can't do that. Which is really sad because all franchises like Star Wars, James Bond, Harry Potter have great catchy themes that the soundtrack is supposed to play with.  With a setting in Spain, how could they not come up with a soundtrack that matched Gladiator's is beyond me...  Any soundtrack from the games especially Syndicate is better than the movie's which is hard to believe. What happened?  Besides a musical lack of talent in terms of creating a soundtrack, I believe the director's brother was influenced by the one-of-a-kind bombastic sound in the Assassin's creed Revelations trailer which features Woodkid's Iron song and to this date remains the best trailer ever made for a movie or game.  The issue is that he is nowhere as talented and couldn't choreograph music to fight scenes like Ubisoft did in that trailer - check it out if you can.There's also no sense of humor at all in the movie to make any character likable and to develop a character.  So do yourself a favor, save your money, and your hopes and go watch a better movie, or better yet, play one of the games again."
4,"As a fan-made film, this film will certainly please fans of the Assassin's Creed series. For everyone else, this film is an utter mess.For a two-hour film, there is little to no story for the audience to follow, and while there are some aspects of sci-fi, action and drama they are not given any proper explanations, motives or developments throughout the entire film. By the end it becomes a hot podge of pointless action and CGI that ruins the build-up made from the beginning of the film.Even as a fan of the early Assassin's Creed series, this movie is simply a disappointment."
4,"Not until when the criticism speaks badly of the adaptations cinematograficas based in videojuegos, and Assassin's Creed is probably one of them, to pear of which the script has been good, and exactly the cinematography, the rhythm of the film and the performances Of the protagonists were bad, but that can be justified, so that in another adptacion of a video game is not a disaster."

10,"What a sorry state of affairs when critics don't know or understand the source material and base their reviews on their own ignorance, such is the case with Assassin's Creed.I have read so many reviews where they get so much wrong, one thought the Assassin Brotherhood is the Assassin's Creed, (I had to point out it was a motto!) and others thought it was the Brotherhood and not the Templars who operated the Animus.As they understand so little, I can tell you they are wrong about this movie, it delivers with gusto and stays true to the feel of the games and improves upon it, it has a cross combination with the Matrix meeting Jedi Knights.I was sceptical, the association of game to movie is a known hoodoo to many, but this would've worked had the game not ever existed, sadly, many of the critics lack the intelligence to understand the story, which in essence is not difficult to comprehend, Abstergo (Templars) seek an ancient artefact (similar to Nazi's looking for the Ark of the Convenant in Raiders) called the Apple of Eden, it possesses the ability to eradicate free will (so a mind control device), they can only find it by tracing the memory of an assassin called Aguilar and do so by looking at genetic memories of his descendant Callum Lynch, however, each time they access said memories Callum learns the skills of the assassins and finally comes to realise he is being used...simple and straightforward plot, or so you would think, however, this seems to have bamboozled critics who don't have a clue what is going on and in their frustration at their own ineptitude to understand, they give it negative marks.Make no mistake, the Oscar nominated trio of Fassbender, Cotillard and Irons give solid performances and the fight scenes and feel of the movie are a joy to behold, sadly, much of the negativity generated is from those who either a: never liked the games b: never played the games c: just don't like games at all (which covers a lot of critics) or d: not happy that Ubisoft did not include references to Altair, Ezio or any other assassin used in the games.It's a shame this movie has been derided by a few, but this is evidence of yet again that many critics feel the only way to get their views noticed is to provide a negative review because they were too lazy to at least find some context in the source material, i.e. they knew that AC universe was big in the games arena, but because of their dislike of games intruding in the film world, they went into the movie with their minds already made up....and those who did try to have an open mind, quickly deciding that because they lack understanding of the story the film was stupid...when in fact the stupidity was of their own making.A very good movie, plenty of action and a solid retelling of the core Assassins Creed ethos, the sequences of Callum and Aguilar mirroring each other's action are breath-taking, as is the feel of the Spanish inquisition, the games often captured the feeling of the era they were set in, and the same is true of the movie, a lot of rich and glorious detail went into the recreation of the year 1492.And those who know Assassins Creed know that the assassins fighting skills gave them the edge, and this is not overlooked in the movie, some amazing set pieces utilising the parkour skills of the assassins which you can clearly associate with the game world, think Jason Bourne mixed with the skills of Egsy (Kingsman) and you get an idea of the visual treat the well choreographed fight scenes do provide.The acting is very good, Fassbender pulls off a very disinterested Callum to begin with, choosing not to believe the world he has found himself in, and more concerned with being free (he was convicted of murder) than stopping the plans of the Templars, that is until he finds the truth of why he witnessed his mother dead at the hands of his father, he then realises that not everything is as it first seemed.Sadly, in a world now where so many movies are put down with consummate ease and the critics can sway your decision, so many will miss out on a terrific movie that doesn't deserve the negativity and subsequently the lack of box office appeal due to the ignorance of the critics and their unwillingness to at least find out a little of the story, I am quite sad to realise this may not see a sequel, but I am glad it got made all the same, so thank you Mr Fassbender and Mr Kurzel for doing Assassin's Creed the justice it deserved."
10,"Perfect for an Assassin's Creed filmThey hit all the major points. You can feel so many of the games in the film without the story being copy and pasted. The free running is perfect, the fighting is perfect, the fact that there isn't much dialogue is perfect!Some reviews would have you believe that everything is CGI but with a 30 sec google search you can find that one of the best gymnasts turn free runners was a stunt man for this film and the iconic Leap Of Faith was actually done by him, not CGI!Anybody who is a fan of the game series from Assassin's Creed 1 to Revelations will enjoy this film!"
6,"Thrilling action sequences are hammered down by a ludicrous plot and too much time spent in the present world in Assassin's Creed. Having been a huge fan of the games, I thoroughly enjoyed the sequences that took place during the Spanish inquisition, unfortunately too much of the film is spent trying to explain it all to those that do not know the background."
3,"Disappointing, even from the perspective of a person who had no knowledge of the game. The acting of Fassbender and Cortillard was fine, just fine, both are good actors but it seems like they gave up on this film. The plot was weak, the best qualities of Assassin's Creed series were not portrayed here. The PG-13 thing ruined the authenticity of the film as well."
8,"Just saw this movie last night. I played all the games and am a fan of the fiction. This movie is hands down better than the critics would have you believe. It does feel like they had to rush the story along, and simply didn't have enough time to focus on character development like say a network series, which is unfortunate, but does leave a lot of material for the sequel. The message of the story is clearly explained and interesting, with a lot of references to the games that fit perfectly. There is a ton of potential here. I hope people go see this movie and judge for themselves. For me, the action, actors, story, setting are freaking awesome and I hope they delve deeper in the sequel."
9,"Much better than the critics make it out to be and one of the better films i have seen this year! I implore you to go and give this movie a shot as i went in with low expectations from the low critic reviews its been receiving and i came out enjoying it immensely and look forward to a sequel if one is to be made!"
8,"For me, the movie was incredibly enjoyable. I was also afraid that the critics would be right, but they weren't. Give it a go, you will like it, if not, just turn it off.The beginning is perhaps the worst part of the movie, however, the rest is very engaging and full of anticipation. 'OMG! What's gonna happen now!? I wanna know! I wanna know!'The adaptation of the Animus may not be perfect but served well in the movie and represented it's potency.The plot is not confusing at all, it just flashes quickly between places and you have to understand the memories he goes in aren't determined by them. I believe some critics didn't grasp this aspect.Some motivations of the characters were not clear but that doesn't compromise the enjoyment of the action and the well-choreographed fights. The parkour was good too.These are some symbolism that you cannot understand without playing the game and which makes the game very special if you're a player of a big fan of Assassin's Creed.Leaving the Spanish language greatly assisted the setting and immersion into the movie.I believe this movie does indeed divide waters and create a new quality level for films based on games.I'd be happy to watch a sequel, and I am waiting for it.I do not agree with the critics and I do not understand what they were waiting for. Definitely a movie worth to watch."
8,"Suspenseful action movie. The 3D quality was lacking a bit (near objects were a little bit blurred) and the caption was sometimes double. I think that was a problem of the cinema, though.I didn't play the computer game but was positively surprised of this movie."
9,"I was totally hyped until I've read the first critics reviews and was really scared to be disappointed. After the first user opinions I was a bit calmed down but now after watching the movie...Oh my god, this was so good!!! They nailed it almost totally and I enjoyed it so much. While the credits where rolling I just wanted to start from the beginning again. They really captured the heart of the game and managed to bring it to a bigger audience.I already love the Resident Evil Movies but can admit, that they do not have the same feeling like the games and are just random actioners. But the Assassin's Creed Movie, really felt like the game and also like a big movie.If you love the franchise, go ahead and enjoy the movie."

But this movie is a great improvement and adds a lot of stuff to the lore. Many will disagree but for me this is the first succesful video game adaptation.The best of the movie are without doubt the scenes in the past and Michael Fassbender as both Aguilar and Lynch. The worst may have been the ending, it looked a bit rushy. For the next one they should make it longer and with more blood, two things that a game like Assassin's Creed deserves on the big screen."

10,"For those of us who actually played the game, this movie captures the essence of the video game completely! if you were expecting for the movie to start at the very beginning, especially after playing the game, then you will be disappointed, and there would really be no point in watching the movie! It has been 13 years since I exited a movie, in like fashion of the movie just watched, but I had to take a small leap of faith, more than half way up the movie theater, to show my admiration of this movie! I personally give full marks to everyone who contributed to this movie! Also if you are expecting over 60-120 hrs of gameplay to be implimented in a 2 hour movie, then you are just being stupid!I, for one, envy Mr. Fassbender's role!"
10,"I almost didn't see this movie after seeing the negative critic reviews, however, better logic won me over as I have played the games and loved them. This movie was awesome for a person who knows setting and what is going on, I believe Ubisoft tailored this game towards the fans and not newcomers and in that they did an amazing job. I am left wanting to go see this movie again, Fassbender and his supporting cast played the hell out of their roles. I thought the revamped version of the 'Animus' looked stupid in the previews and was very surprised it didn't bother me while watching and it in fact grew on me as I started to understand the change more. I loved the visuals and the setting. All that being said I believe the main cause for the bad reviews from some is the fact that they have not played the games and do not know the world, followed by Ubisoft shoving information from a game that lasts anywhere from 8-30 hours and has time to explain into a 2 hour movie and that may have confused some.The character development was there and maybe some are used to long drawn out explanations that would have been considered boring in an awesome action flick like this, I felt I knew each characters role and where they were coming from.I would implore anyone interested to give it a chance and go see it if you are a fan of the games or just really like a good action movie, its worth the time and money....which is surprising for a video game adaptation"
10,"Michael Fassbender is a good actor who can carry a franchise, and the film serves as a compelling origin story for Sophia Rikkin, as well as Callum Lynch. Clumsy exposition doesnt ruin a film that has a strong visual identity, fantastic action sequences and characters that Im ready to spend more time with already."

10,"As someone who has studied film and never played the games, I do not understand for the life of me these negative reviews. I can say from an unbiased point of view this movie actually had my heart pounding almost the entire film simply for how well it was crafted. The film was visually stunning, acting was sublime, cinematography ground breaking and original. These attributes are impressive alone even if you disregard the important political message laced through the film (I was not expecting that!). I guess the same people who gave this a 10/100 probably voted a 100 for bland, brain-sludge films like the new ghostbusters. How unfortunate there are so many uneducated people out there with the mental retention for nothing. This was truly a masterpiece."
9,"DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE HATE GUYS!! READ PLZ.I've come all the way from the mystic land of IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to spread the truth of this movie as a person who has actually played the games. Kinda goes to show how frustrated I am about this injustice...As a lover of the Assassin's Creed universe, I find this a really enjoyable movie. I really don't understand all the hate. Maybe it's because people expect something bad and end up seeing only the flaws, especially since video game movies are usually really bad. I love how they depicted the life of modern day assassins; it fleshed it out very well, and it showed without hesitation what the Creed is about. The scenery is beautiful; the animus (though different) provides an immersion I appreciate; the fighting scenes are very similar to the combat experienced in the games (the climbing too! which is AWESOME); the ending makes sense if you've played the games. I admit that there are flaws like the movie focusing a lot more on the modern assassins rather than the ancestral ones (the games focus more on the ancestors if ya didn't know), but they are understandable changes considering the new audience. I think it would've been a little better with me if they treated the movie like another Assassin's Creed game. So basically, to a newcomer into the Assassin's Creed world, they will either get confused and hate the movie because they don't understand it, or they will experience it like one of Marvel's superhero movies, but with a strange emptiness similar to that of Ex Machina. For people who have played the games and don't enjoy it just for the thrills, I think you'll be very surprised at what the movie accomplished. I know I was.Kinda funny how the movie's like 'We work in the darkenss to serve the light' and that's exactly what it's doing in real life. Just goes to show what a good movie it is. xDP.S.

8,"Seeing this through the eyes of a gamer who has played almost all of the AC games, I have to say, this checks so many of the boxes I wanted it to check. It's a love letter to the source material, and a treat for the fans, but, I can only assume, a confusing mess for others.Me? I found it difficult to wipe the big fat smile off my face while Callum / Aguilar is racing through buildings, on rooftops, killing guards left and right before doing a Leap of Faith. All of the action is so well done and shot, full of practical effects and stunts, and a spectacular, fast paced style, reminiscent of the games themselves.Now, I am not an idiot. This is a flawed movie, especially when it comes to its convoluted, disappointing story. There's no real stakes, there's no real enemy, just a very silly chase for an 'apple', and characters - whether Templars or Assassins - you never end up caring about. And it's a shame - the games provide a great framework in which thousands of different stories can be told. I wish they crafted a better one.But, in the end, what got me was everything else. The breathtaking action. The incredible cinematography. All the winks to fans. The weirdness of it all, an expensive weirdness the likes Hollywood has never seen before. (Seriously, name me another movie with a budget as high as this one that is so unconcerned with being mainstream).Also, props to Justin Kurzel and his DP, Adam Arkapaw. After crafting the most beautiful 'Macbeth' ever put on film, here they go again, proving they are among the most interesting visual filmmakers of these recent years."

They are always looking for something overly artsy, like The Witch, and can't just like something for what it is. Is it an Oscar winning life changing movie? No. It does the games justice while tweaking a few things.If you enjoy Assassin's Creed game series you will most likely enjoy this movie and will look forward to a sequel."

It still has some problems and if you played the games, you will already know the plot twists and see them coming from a mile away. However if you didn't play the games, then you will probably get lots of enjoyment out of it as well. I went and saw it with a person who never heard of the games and they still understood it and enjoyed it a lot. And while this movie shares a similar plot to the games, it is not accurate to the games at all. This movie is it's own thing, and I appreciate that. They made the game's main plot points and ideas work in movie form, but they didn't go all out and copy the games. As a result this will feel different to the games, but I still enjoyed it. Overall, it was a pretty decent movie."
7,"Assassin's Creed doesn't offer a solid, well written plot. Fortunately the core of the movie is not about the plot and doesn't overexert in trying to explain itself. It focuses and makes the most out of what the AC franchise is known for: amazing acrobatic moves and combat, exotic setting and the mystery surrounding the assassins. In addition, with the movie played by excellent actors (Fassbender and Cotillard) who take their role seriously, Assassin's Creed the movie holds its ground against any other box office movies."
8,"This is a film adaptation that is aimed towards those who have a significant amount of knowledge of Assassin's Creed. Those who haven't played the games won't understand what this movie is all about and what it's going for.Also, to those saying that most of it should be set in the past and not the present, do you really think making 99% of the film in the Spanish Inquisition and just having short five minute scenes in Abstergo would translate well into a movie? After all, it wouldn't be Assassin's Creed without the Animus and First Civilization lore, that's what make up Assassin's Creed, it's not just the hoods and hidden blades. I'm glad this stays true to its source material. It didn't shy away from the games deep and complex story."

7,"I thought this movie was a fine made film for Assassin's Creed fans and audiences that want a decent action flick. There were a few problems with it but I believe my money was well spent.Story - The movie is set in the same world of the video games on 2016. The main Protagonist is Callum Lynch that has connections with the Assassin Order that has been at war with the Templar's throughout centuries. Callum is forced to go onto the Animus, a machine that is programmed to relieve the subject ancestors memories through Genetic DNA. The lead of this project is Sophia Rikkin, a scientist that will lead Callum to one of the pieces of Eden known as the Apple of Eden for her order the Templars. One my person note I thought the story was thought out real well as it helped us connect Callums understanding of his purpose and the issues Sophia Rikkin was going through. The few problems with the story though is that the side characters introduced didn't have enough screen time to care and that the memories visited  during the Spanish Inquisition weren't long enough to care for the Assassin Agulair. Setting- One of the few best things of the film was that it recreated the lore of the Assassin's Creed into perfection. Everything I saw felt natural as if it was nostalgia. The color of the film too created a atmosphere basing on the scenes that were shown. Acting- The acting was done well enough to help the viewer be entertained though there were some flat acting from the few associates of Callums and the Abstergo employees.Overall the film was made well enough to make me entertained. It's not a film for everyone but I do recommend watching it to see for yourself if you like it or not. Some films don't deserve to be seen like After Earth but some other like this is deserved to be seen at least once."
10,"If you watched Jeremy Jahn's, Chris Stuckmann's, or Angry Joe's ReviewRead this!!!!!By coming to Metacritic I'm assuming some of you are gamers and want this movie to be good. Well fret no longer. I will explain my experience in detail without spoilers and why it is so good. So here goes. The reasons reviews were so low was because the storyline to the movie is NOT the same as the storyline to any game. That being said, this NEW story is not about Desmond, Ezio or any of the older characters in the Assassins Creed universe. However, it is about a new character called Callum Lynch (Cal) and his experiences in trying to help Abstergo in trying to find Ezio's Apple of Eden- and they do an excellent job (I actually even managed to hear claps from the audience by the end while walking out.) The fight scenes were excellent, and so were the Villains and the Abstergo workers that each created a nice atmosphere. The only problem I have is the title. It should not have been called 'Assassins Creed' because it was a new expansion to the universe. I would have rather preferred 'Assassins Creed: Callum and the Apple of Edan' because the first 5 minutes I was looking for Desmond and was confused.Regardless this did not ruin my experience and I would VERY much love for a sequel. Thank you and if you are a Gamer or an Assassins Creed Fan. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie :)"

Do not listen to critics it's a great movie. Gamer writer think they're the experts and always searching mistakes. Yes, It could be better, but it's a good start.

10,"I've been a fan of AC since 2008 when i played the first game... by now i fully understand the story and narrative, and continuity of all these stories being all connected. The overwhelming aspect is the long ass war between Assassins and Templars and fighting for control of order and peace through First Civ tech called pieces of Eden. By the way, if you don't know anything about the games, books, and comic-books and lore of this series you may not enjoy the film. In my opinion, I loved this movie, it hits everything i like about the games (stealthy aspects/eavesdropping/the action & combat + hidden blades) and its very stunning, and visually entertaining! the atmosphere is well made! Top Notch Cinematographer, Adam Arkapaw, same dude that worked on Macbeth another Fassbender film! which Fassbender should get an award/nominated the best male performance, I loved his take on both characters Callum Lynch and Aguilar de Nerha. loved all the references and Easter eggs throughout the film!  Justin Kurzel did a fantastic job for the whole composition, i was surprised though that is was short of 2 hours, it really told the story in a fresh pace. THIS IS a video-game movie!10 out of 10 for me!"
7,"Assassin's Creed is by no means a perfect film. In places it falls flat, in other places it feels scared and lacks confidence in itself and the story overall isn't anything special or memorable. However, the cinematography, the costumes, the world that has been created is stunning. It feels like Assassin's Creed and does the games justice in that aspect. Several sequences in the film take your breath away with how action packed and bad ass they feel and the casting suits the film perfectly.    A lot of people were sceptical about the new animus and how that would work. But I must say it was brilliant, it translates perfectly to film and just makes the action sequences that much better. I would say that if you are an Assassin's Creed fan you will watch it and most probably enjoy it for what it is. A lot of people seemed to have jumped on the hate band wagon and not given it the reviews it deserves.    I would watch it again as I definitely enjoyed it and would even welcome a sequel. I think they tried to play it safe with this film and some of it paid off, some of it really didn't.At the end of the day, they had a hard job. They had to please the fans who know the games as well as pleasing people who are new to the Assassins Creed universe. Finding that balance is difficult and when you get torn between pleasing both parties you either end up with on screen magic, or a confusing and poorly explained couple of scenes. This film did both of the above."
9,"I dont understand why so many of these so-called official reviews carried such a negative narrative. As a player of Assassin's Creed, and as someone who has just watched the show, I thought the movie was pretty good. Even my wife (who is not a fan or a gamer enjoyed the story and could follow the plot)This is definitely a 8 or an 9 for me."

8,"The Assassin's Creed movie stays true to the original game source and is everything a gamer has wanted in an Assassin's Creed movie. The Lore and mythology of the movie is like you see in the game and the movie while offering a different story line stays true to the lore.Even for the people who havn't played the game before, the movie does an excellent job of outlining the plot and explaining who both sides of this eternal struggle are. Very worth while seeing and looking forward to seeing where the franchise goes from here."
10,"Even tho lots of ppl didnt like the movie, i loved it. There is so much things i see differently. I am a huge AC fan and I was waiting for all the running in the rooftops, leap of faith and everything you can do in the game - and i got it. I agree story was full of holes - but i didnt mind it. As long as I can see 'Ezio' in real life doing his parkour things, i am happy ^^"

7,"j'ai trouv le film vraiment pas mal. il nous mne dans l'ambiance du premier assassin's creed (le jeux) et les labos abstergo sur le projet animus.comme pour Desmond, Fassbender est le sujet qui permettra aux templiers d'imposer leurs volonts.le film propose ce qui a fait le succs de cette IP et utilise tous ce qu'il peut pour mettre  l'aise les initis. je n'en dis pas plus.la plus part des scnes d'actions se passent dans l'animus, le pass (espagne 1492) et en espagnol sous titr, qui reprsentent bien plus d'1/4 du film...plus dans les 3/7 et prsente l'intrigue, les protagonistes dans le btiment d'abstergo de madrid. comme pour la trilogie Desmond, la pomme d'eden est l'objet convoit par les templiers.l'interprtation mcanique de l'animus n'est pas vraiment surprenante dans le sens ou l'acquisition des comptences du crdo s'apprennent pendant la synchronisation avec son anctre. dans l'ensemble, le film alterne le rythme de narration et essaye d'approfondir le contenu en peu de temps pour arriver aux moments que les spectateurs attendent le plus. le rendu est trs correct mais dans l'ensemble, les scnes manquent d'espace, car le cadrage manque d'envergure et les plans sont dans l'ensemble plutt serr. seul les interventions (trop nombreuses) du fameux rapace prsentent de jolies traveling.pour la bande son, je trouve qu'elle accompagne bien le film mais manque rellement d'identit  dfaut d'tre trs percutante.sinon, le film, est franchement pas mal, sans pour autant tre transcendant, mais j'ai bien retrouv l'me du jeux vido (premier du nom) qui m'avait emball  l'poque. rien n'est parfait, mais pour un premier essai, je trouve que UBI a russi l'exercice.suite au prochain numro."
8,"Well, I love the games, I liked the film. Yes, there is room for improvement, but still, it is a very good film. Truth be told, I went to the cinema with mixed feelings - quite frankly, I didn't like the idea of moving Animus, and the music in the trailer was terrible. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised. The moving Animus fits the film incredibly well. In a way it makes the training/improving skills of the descendant by Animus exposure much more believable. In my opinion, the film is more appreciated by those who know and play(ed) the games before. Why? For example, because my friend asked me after the end of the film: 'Why was the bird there all the time?' Well, how to answer that..."
8,"Not sure why these critics can't take a movie without much humor, but don't let those negative reviews dissuade you; this is one hell of an entertaining movie. It manages to be familiar enough to the game franchise so that fans of the games can enjoy it, and the movie proves welcoming enough to newcomers who have never played the games before so that they can enjoy it too. The story is presented in an easy-to-understand method, unlike Warcraft, and it's plot proves very intricate and interesting, like the games. This film is also filled with riveting, intense fight scenes, stellar acting, and a substantial plot that keeps you entertained. My only complaints stem from a few holes here and there, but overall, this is a step in the right direction for video game movies."

9,"In Alan Rikkins own words in the movie (or similar): 'Not my best work but everyone will understand what I mean.' It looks and feels like Assassin's Creed. Sometimes there are strange moments in the way how characters act because the movie is fast and full of things so that they can't really develop. Rikkins words fits there really well.But I can say that I enjoyed the movie and would love to see a sequel."
10,"Purists who expect the movie to be a 1-to-1 adaptation of the games, or a sequel to the series will be disappointed, it is not. However, it does a masterful job of condensing a universe created during five 80-hour-apiece games into a single 2.5 hour movie. This does mean the exposition needs to come quickly, but not overwhelmingly quickly.The plot is reminiscent of the first game, for the most part, but is split more evenly between the past and the present. While riveting, the effect comes not from suspense and unexpected twists, but more from the beautifully choreographed fight scenes of Aguilar's mission that cut back to the present to show the Animus's ethereal recreation of the memories as they play out. The possibility of sequels is left open, but all the immediate plot points are resolved, which makes the movie viable as an independent piece as well.Visuals play a big part in the movie, from the squalid slums and artistic castles of the past to the clean, technocratic Abstergo compound, they are all perfectly executed. CGI is there, naturally, but it fits the rest of the movie and is not jarring or out-of-place. If seen in 3D, the depth is natural and greatly aids immersion during the fight and escape sequences,The Animus and its execution deserves separate praise: though starkly different from the game's sleek, user-friendly device, the mechanical contraption moves with a fluidity that makes it look surprisingly graceful and fitting for the ethereal recreations of the protagonist's memories. Some might find the overlay sequences (where the Animus chamber is shown with the memories being projected) blurred and hard to see - I'll admit I had to focus as well, but I found the effect to be fitting for the ethereal nature of the memories, and on some level, the machine itself.The soundtrack does a great job of not being there overtly. There are intro and ending pieces ... and that seems to be it. During the movie, the entire score seems to be absent, it feels more like ambience than actual music being used to underpin the action.The combat scenes are what carry the movie: the choreographers captured the fighting style of the game's assassins faithfully, and succeeded where even many players did not - proper use of the iconic Hidden Blade. The graceful, acrobatic moves of the Assassins stand in stark contrast with the opponents' clumsy, brute-force approach; while during the escape sequences, the Assassins make full use of their environment, just as the games encourage the players, climbing, vaulting, and hopping with practiced grace.There is not much to be said for negatives. I DID miss the game's Eagle Vision (the Assassin equivalent of clairvoyance that allows them to discern their target and discover hidden patterns in the world around them), I hope we'll get to see its debut in the next movie. The Apple's power could have been expanded upon as well (it is used as a weapon and a tool several times in the games), but this is likely something that is reserved for a sequel.All in all, I would say that the film is an exceedingly well-done adaptation, not of a game series, but of a universe. The plot does not follow the pre-established story, but creates its own, and while somewhat exposition-heavy, the difference of duration between the originals and the film must be kept in mind.I would recommend it to anyone who likes action films or the game series without a second thought."
10,"The very low Critic reviews (not users) clearly show why metacritic is not to be taken seriously, i mean they even admit to not have played a single one of the games, and then critize the movie as 'non coherent plot'.. sure, when you dont unsderstand hundreds of hours of the source material, how can you expect to judge anything? This just shows these kind of 'certified critics' are a hoax, and should critize no more than their own bathroom loo (if they spend quality time with it, i mean)."
7,"This is a film tailor-made for hardcore Assassin's Creed fans. If you know nothing about the Assassin's Creed universe, you will end up with 100000 questions marks in your head while and after watching it. Everything core about the game is preserved. It feels like the first Assassin's Creed game very much. And by mentioning core I mean it is about the modern day story. The modern day story is the core please!!! The action is well-designed and my heart is jumping fast and my hands sweat a lot! Don't believe the critics 100%, see it for yourself after getting some background knowledge about the game before you watch it. The actors are quite good. Though I would like the film to dig more into the ancestor story as well as the conflicts between the core values of Assassins and Templars. More elaborations would be great. But this at least for me does not become a letdown because the story itself is already enough for a 2-hour length. Overall, the film has brought the game to life in the reality of 2016. I'm feeling a strong 7, tran-"
6,"I'm not Assassin's Creed gamer. But, I guess this movie is good. Yet, this movie has a lot of plotholes. Or I guess I don't know much about the premise. I've tried to focus on this movie, but I don't understand about the story. Yet, it's amazing when it's showing the past of main character's ancestor. It's action packed and thrilling. Yeah, this movie is still good, although the story isn't great."
6,"This movie was so disappointing! I'm a huge Assassin's Creed gamer, i've played all the games, I read the books, and I even have a AC tattoo. This movie is for teens that's why its PG13. AC is violent and bloody and in the movie guys are getting there throats cut with no blood to show. The game is all about stealth where the movie was like 5 on 20 combat. The movie was more about Abstergo then actual Assassins. Especially disappointed because Michael Fassbender is awesome."

4,"So, just got done watching 'Assassin's Creed' and I went into this film hoping for the best as this was a video game to silver screen film. First I'll start off by saying, when you have a winning formula, why change it? Sure we have played the games, we know the stories, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't have loved to see a live action adaptation of the first game. Michael Fassbender, did a great job playing his character,  sure it's a little strange to see him speaking Spanish but hey whatever,  the guy has depth.  The film is set during the Spanish Inquisition and Fassbender plays Aguilar de Nerha a man who has lost his entire family and has pledged his life to the brotherhood of Assassin's to protect free will against the Templars.   The graphics were superb and the locations were beautifully designed with high amounts of detail. Choreography was horrific in most scenes and the acting skills of the no name, could care less about them, extra would be assassins was also laughable. They try to be intense and just come off as trying to hard.  Jeremy Irons plays the opposite part of our hero as Abstergo C.E.O.,  Dr. Rikken who is hell bent on pushing the limits of our hero to find 'the Apple of Eden' a relic from the Garden of Eden that contains the seed of the first act of disobedience against God in the Animus a machine designed by Dr. Rikken's daughter Sofia, played by the beautiful Marion Cotillard, who in this film seemed rather stiff in her role, a role and character that we don't get much information on, other than the fact that she has designed the animus and that she is trying to help rid the world of violence. If you are looking for any semblance of the Assassin's creed games that you enjoy, you will only find it in the, the armblades, the disappear into the crowd moves, the leap of faiths, the running on rooftops and the eagles that point out view points. Be prepared to be leaving this movie thinking,  'Wow, Mortal Kombat was better than this movie'. They couldn't even get the Animus right.-Admin Devin"
2,"If you can't agree that video game movies are (at least) bad in general, then you have to seriously look up a ton of reasons why they are expected to fail in critical reception. Assassin's Creed is no exception to the list of failed video game movies. Why can't people leave video games as they are and not make them movies? They just don't listen nowadays... sigh."

The images flash by like theyre trying to cure Malcolm McDowell of his violent tendencies. No character seems sympathetic or even interesting. The story makes no sense.

Such drab and one-dimensional plotting/characters that the whole movie becomes a plot-hole for itself. A few nice setpieces though.Don't hold your breath for a sequel, this one isnt doing good at the box office. But hey 10/10 because videogames!"
5,"Assassins creed is a pretty straightforward franchise. Its about historical conflicts, and cool dudes that run around taking out major targets whilst doing awesome parkour. I'm not a huge fan of the games (I've only ever played IV) but as someone who is into history, I was pretty stoked for this movie. On top of that, Assassins Creed is also a reunion For Justin Kurzel, Michael Fassbender, and Marion Cotillard; who all worked on the most recent version of Macbeth, which I absolutely loved. My expectations for this movie were high. So high, in fact, that I disregarded the overwhelming onslaught of hate that came in the wake of the movie's early screenings. Boy, was I wrong.Justin Kurzel is a great director. He has a gift in his manipulation of fog, dust, and light. He did great things in Macbeth, especially with the final confrontation, and he does similarly great things here...at least when the screenplay permits it. The setting that I had most looked forward to; fifteenth century Spain, at the height of the inquisition, barely gets 30 minutes of screen time, if that. The ferocious beauty that Kurzel's visual style brings to the table is never given time to become the prepossessing masterpiece I know it could have become. The epic acrobatics, tense sequences of martial arts combat, and exotic weaponry scarcely sink in before the viewers, just like Callum Lynch, are jerked back to a monotone and boring laboratory, that serves as the setting for most of the movie.At one point in the film, when the villainous Templar priest finally lays his oppressive hands on the apple of Eden, the movie's sought after artifact, Aguilar, and his Assassin partner leap down into a cloud of grey smoke, emerging from the shadows here, and there, laying absolute waste to the Templar. This is a moment of cinematic triumph, and Kurzel ought to be pleased. Next however, as Aguilar seizes the priest, he looks across the room, and sees his partner just as she is murdered by a Templar enforcer. An epic duel ensues. Climactic combat is Fassbender's forte. The man shows his emotions so well with his facial expressions. This woman is his wife, presumably, or his lover perhaps. However, I have no idea who she is; heck, i don't even know what her name is. The movies plot prevents you from being emotionally invested in the most adrenaline pumping part of the story, because the script focuses on what has to be the most positively tedious plot device in Assassins Creed.This movie was Ubisoft's chance to disconnect the Assassins Creed franchise from the half-baked convoluted sci-fi plot devices that are part and parcel of the games. Instead, the film chooses to be a movie that is almost solely, a half baked-convoluted plot device, with a dash of fantastic stunt work on the side.I am usually pretty optimistic after a movie. It takes very little to please me. My rating scale tends to peak at 'perfect', and reach its low at 'just good'. I'm sad to say that I wanted Assassin's Creed to end. Once I realized that there were no more animus sequences coming my way, I had no reason to care anymore. This was not, sitting on the edge of my seat, or wishing the film would hurry up and get to the climax. I legitimately wanted the movie to be over, so the credits would roll, and I could get up and leave.Assassin's Creed is a tragedy. So much talent was involved, and clearly, plenty of hard work went into it. A few times, Kurzel's pictorial virtuosity is allowed to shine through the weary and trite plot, but for the most part, it is suppressed by how vapid and incomplete everything else is. It is a pity. Assassins Creed was chock full of potential, but it couldn't have fallen more short."

4,"The last movie by director Justin Kurzel was 'Macbeth', which marked him as an impressive visual stylist. His latest, based on the popular video games, still boasts impressive visuals, but lacks the narrative heft to make it work. Michael Fassbender plays the last descendant of the Assassins, a secret society that battles the Templars for an end to violence and mankind's free will. The simplistic plot is one that only a video game could spawn and it's inevitably peppered with lots of action. Kurzel has created dense imagery (with lots of dust and smoke) and his fights are high-energy, although ultimately repetitive and tiresome. The best thing that I can say about this film is that Fassbinder spends about 1/3 of it fighting and flexing shirtless."
3,"Like every movie based on a video game. They don't stick with the story, I mean sure they did that but if you expect more, you will surely be disappointed.

Action sequences were pretty okay but the rest is just garbage."

2,"It's hilarious to read the positive user reviews on Metacritic.  At best, it's the worst movie you'll watch in a year and possibly the worst in a decade.  I don't expect much from a movie (I give 3-4 stars to movies that get 2 from others) but this was just ridiculous - a baby inside his/her mother's womb could have made a better movie than this.On the subject of good reviews, they talk about fight scenes but the fight scenes are actually horrible in this movie and turn Jason Bourne and Mission Impossible into Epic Bonanzas.  Same with Parkour scenes - there was one lame parkour scene that's worse than anything my son has done in AC2, Revelations, Black Flag, Unity and Syndicate. What on earth did they like?  They can't seriously have liked the Animus, they couldn't have liked the melody-less and unharmonious music, they couldn't have liked the story, the cinematography and editing were a mess of epic proportions (blur and fog have nothing to do with Assassin's Creed).  I get that they like the title and the game (so do I) but that does NOT make a good movie. Generally speaking the positive reviews center on monosyllabic epithets which are usually incorrectly spelt so if your appreciate the lamest badass Templar fight in history then by all means watch the movie and enjoy it... If you watch the movie, remember how ridiculous the main bad guy was.  You know nothing about him and you won't even have any recollection of seeing him fight or wielding his sword like a true swordmaster. I believe the director has hired all his family to dislike the negative reviews as he did in the movie.  The movie is such a tragedy that it turns Macbeth into Seinfeld.My son and I love the games.  Coming off the heels of Black Flag which we completed twice (on the Xbox and Xbox One) and the incredible Syndicate with its beautiful Victorian settings and music, we expected the movie to honor this series which merges fiction with historical figures and locations. First, the movie is a family affair (see below to learn how the director hired his wife and brother for pivotal parts in the movie).  Second, I don't believe the director has played the games and understands what sets Assassin's creed games apart from other games so there's no way he could make a movie worthy of the games.Unfortunately the movie was extremely disappointing and it's prompted me to write a review which I've never done before. The depth of the story is really low as is the character development.  Why is this important?  Because you need to 'connect' with the characters in any good movie.  You won't connect with the actors in the movie as you did with Ezio, Kenway, or Jacob and Evie Frye.  Many of the fight scenes are blurry and badly choreographed and that's such a big part of Assassin's Creed.  Like the movie, you are wondering what happened as opposed to thinking 'wow what an incredible move'.  The concept of the new animus is nice but they use it in every scene and it destroys any suspension of disbelief that the story is taking place in another timeline.  Every 10 seconds in a fight scene you come back to the original timeline and then go back.  It's like being taken out of London or Havana in the game to see the animus every minute...During the movie, my entire family wanted to leave because of the bombastic sound of the soundtrack.  Unfortunately, the director hired his brother (and his wife as an actress) and he couldn't come up with a decent score or a catchy melody so he blasts heavy metal music throughout 30%-40% of the movie even without action scenes.  Well, you simply can't do that. Which is really sad because all franchises like Star Wars, James Bond, Harry Potter have great catchy themes that the soundtrack is supposed to play with.  With a setting in Spain, how could they not come up with a soundtrack that matched Gladiator's is beyond me...  Any soundtrack from the games especially Syndicate is better than the movie's which is hard to believe. What happened?  Besides a musical lack of talent in terms of creating a soundtrack, I believe the director's brother was influenced by the one-of-a-kind bombastic sound in the Assassin's creed Revelations trailer which features Woodkid's Iron song and to this date remains the best trailer ever made for a movie or game.  The issue is that he is nowhere as talented and couldn't choreograph music to fight scenes like Ubisoft did in that trailer - check it out if you can.There's also no sense of humor at all in the movie to make any character likable and to develop a character.  So do yourself a favor, save your money, and your hopes and go watch a better movie, or better yet, play one of the games again."
4,"As a fan-made film, this film will certainly please fans of the Assassin's Creed series. For everyone else, this film is an utter mess.For a two-hour film, there is little to no story for the audience to follow, and while there are some aspects of sci-fi, action and drama they are not given any proper explanations, motives or developments throughout the entire film. By the end it becomes a hot podge of pointless action and CGI that ruins the build-up made from the beginning of the film.Even as a fan of the early Assassin's Creed series, this movie is simply a disappointment."

10,"What a sorry state of affairs when critics don't know or understand the source material and base their reviews on their own ignorance, such is the case with Assassin's Creed.I have read so many reviews where they get so much wrong, one thought the Assassin Brotherhood is the Assassin's Creed, (I had to point out it was a motto!) and others thought it was the Brotherhood and not the Templars who operated the Animus.As they understand so little, I can tell you they are wrong about this movie, it delivers with gusto and stays true to the feel of the games and improves upon it, it has a cross combination with the Matrix meeting Jedi Knights.I was sceptical, the association of game to movie is a known hoodoo to many, but this would've worked had the game not ever existed, sadly, many of the critics lack the intelligence to understand the story, which in essence is not difficult to comprehend, Abstergo (Templars) seek an ancient artefact (similar to Nazi's looking for the Ark of the Convenant in Raiders) called the Apple of Eden, it possesses the ability to eradicate free will (so a mind control device), they can only find it by tracing the memory of an assassin called Aguilar and do so by looking at genetic memories of his descendant Callum Lynch, however, each time they access said memories Callum learns the skills of the assassins and finally comes to realise he is being used...simple and straightforward plot, or so you would think, however, this seems to have bamboozled critics who don't have a clue what is going on and in their frustration at their own ineptitude to understand, they give it negative marks.Make no mistake, the Oscar nominated trio of Fassbender, Cotillard and Irons give solid performances and the fight scenes and feel of the movie are a joy to behold, sadly, much of the negativity generated is from those who either a: never liked the games b: never played the games c: just don't like games at all (which covers a lot of critics) or d: not happy that Ubisoft did not include references to Altair, Ezio or any other assassin used in the games.It's a shame this movie has been derided by a few, but this is evidence of yet again that many critics feel the only way to get their views noticed is to provide a negative review because they were too lazy to at least find some context in the source material, i.e. they knew that AC universe was big in the games arena, but because of their dislike of games intruding in the film world, they went into the movie with their minds already made up....and those who did try to have an open mind, quickly deciding that because they lack understanding of the story the film was stupid...when in fact the stupidity was of their own making.A very good movie, plenty of action and a solid retelling of the core Assassins Creed ethos, the sequences of Callum and Aguilar mirroring each other's action are breath-taking, as is the feel of the Spanish inquisition, the games often captured the feeling of the era they were set in, and the same is true of the movie, a lot of rich and glorious detail went into the recreation of the year 1492.And those who know Assassins Creed know that the assassins fighting skills gave them the edge, and this is not overlooked in the movie, some amazing set pieces utilising the parkour skills of the assassins which you can clearly associate with the game world, think Jason Bourne mixed with the skills of Egsy (Kingsman) and you get an idea of the visual treat the well choreographed fight scenes do provide.The acting is very good, Fassbender pulls off a very disinterested Callum to begin with, choosing not to believe the world he has found himself in, and more concerned with being free (he was convicted of murder) than stopping the plans of the Templars, that is until he finds the truth of why he witnessed his mother dead at the hands of his father, he then realises that not everything is as it first seemed.Sadly, in a world now where so many movies are put down with consummate ease and the critics can sway your decision, so many will miss out on a terrific movie that doesn't deserve the negativity and subsequently the lack of box office appeal due to the ignorance of the critics and their unwillingness to at least find out a little of the story, I am quite sad to realise this may not see a sequel, but I am glad it got made all the same, so thank you Mr Fassbender and Mr Kurzel for doing Assassin's Creed the justice it deserved."
10,"Perfect for an Assassin's Creed filmThey hit all the major points. You can feel so many of the games in the film without the story being copy and pasted. The free running is perfect, the fighting is perfect, the fact that there isn't much dialogue is perfect!Some reviews would have you believe that everything is CGI but with a 30 sec google search you can find that one of the best gymnasts turn free runners was a stunt man for this film and the iconic Leap Of Faith was actually done by him, not CGI!Anybody who is a fan of the game series from Assassin's Creed 1 to Revelations will enjoy this film!"
6,"Thrilling action sequences are hammered down by a ludicrous plot and too much time spent in the present world in Assassin's Creed. Having been a huge fan of the games, I thoroughly enjoyed the sequences that took place during the Spanish inquisition, unfortunately too much of the film is spent trying to explain it all to those that do not know the background."
3,"Disappointing, even from the perspective of a person who had no knowledge of the game. The acting of Fassbender and Cortillard was fine, just fine, both are good actors but it seems like they gave up on this film. The plot was weak, the best qualities of Assassin's Creed series were not portrayed here. The PG-13 thing ruined the authenticity of the film as well."
8,"Just saw this movie last night. I played all the games and am a fan of the fiction. This movie is hands down better than the critics would have you believe. It does feel like they had to rush the story along, and simply didn't have enough time to focus on character development like say a network series, which is unfortunate, but does leave a lot of material for the sequel. The message of the story is clearly explained and interesting, with a lot of references to the games that fit perfectly. There is a ton of potential here. I hope people go see this movie and judge for themselves. For me, the action, actors, story, setting are freaking awesome and I hope they delve deeper in the sequel."
9,"Much better than the critics make it out to be and one of the better films i have seen this year! I implore you to go and give this movie a shot as i went in with low expectations from the low critic reviews its been receiving and i came out enjoying it immensely and look forward to a sequel if one is to be made!"
8,"For me, the movie was incredibly enjoyable. I was also afraid that the critics would be right, but they weren't. Give it a go, you will like it, if not, just turn it off.The beginning is perhaps the worst part of the movie, however, the rest is very engaging and full of anticipation. 'OMG! What's gonna happen now!? I wanna know! I wanna know!'The adaptation of the Animus may not be perfect but served well in the movie and represented it's potency.The plot is not confusing at all, it just flashes quickly between places and you have to understand the memories he goes in aren't determined by them. I believe some critics didn't grasp this aspect.Some motivations of the characters were not clear but that doesn't compromise the enjoyment of the action and the well-choreographed fights. The parkour was good too.These are some symbolism that you cannot understand without playing the game and which makes the game very special if you're a player of a big fan of Assassin's Creed.Leaving the Spanish language greatly assisted the setting and immersion into the movie.I believe this movie does indeed divide waters and create a new quality level for films based on games.I'd be happy to watch a sequel, and I am waiting for it.I do not agree with the critics and I do not understand what they were waiting for. Definitely a movie worth to watch."
8,"This movie teaches kids that they know better than their parents.  Parents don't know what's good.  Following their teenage heart to brave all danger toward exciting frontier is the way to go.It's -1 score if I was judging the movie by its educational value to young girls, but since I believe dumb people will do dumb things, movie or not, I give Moana an 8 because it's a beautifully rendered, sung, and acted Disney feature.  Disney entertainment delivered what is expected of them."
10,"Oh my God. This movie is so damn good. Its not just good, actually. Its a masterpiece. The music is perfect - we're talking about the best Disney musical in the last 20 years. Stunning animation. Likeable characters. Impressive voice acting. A fun and emotional story. Thats Moana. Its the movie you didn't know you want to see."
10,"This is a fantastic film and a must see. Great music throughout the entire film. Good comedy. The story is a standard story, there won't be any surprises. Many movie tropes are directly rejected in the film. It is well worth seeing. It's as fun as you want it to be."
10,"This is Disney at is best, a fantastic combination of commercial appeal and art. The Disney princess is back, with not even a hint of a romantic interest to distract from her heroic (heroinic?) arc. As a fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda, I am ecstatic about the songs. The themes of islands, heroism, family, and tradition are right up his alley. The Rock is perfectly cast and gives a career-high performance. No one could have done his part better. I am not an expert on Polynesian culture, but everything feels perfectly authentic. They've come a long way since the Tiki Room. And finally, the animation is another step forward for Disney. They've always excelled at rendering water, but the water is literally a character in the story here."
10,"This movie was amazing. From the spectacular CGI to the funny humor for all ages to the great story. This movie has it all and it will be remembered as an instant disney classic in the same category as aladdin, lion king, beauty and the beast, and toy story. I find no fault in this movie 10/10. This is a movie for all ages to enjoy."
6,"Heh. I had so high hopes after Zootopia, but that movie did not met them. Imagine a book, that is really good book, with good plot, good characters and good settings, but when you finish that book you feel something is odd, that book was too long, the begging was way too slow and some its 'crucial' aspects like songs were overused."
7,"The film's heart is in the right place, it is animated beautifully, and it breaks mold by introducing a princess that does not chance after a man.The humor, however, plays on the same type of joke of slapstick and potty joke and makes little to no sense. The songs also don't do much to contribute to the story.Moana is like that PG&J sandwich that is eaten just to be eaten. Good, but not perfect."
10,"Moana is the best Disney movie in a while. Excellent art design, great music, and good humor. I appreciate the story as well. It should work well for kids, but there is enough substance for adults. Auli'i Cravalho (Moana) is an excellent voice actress, and an excellent singer that I hope will carve out a career from here. If you watch Disney movies, there is no reason not to watch this one. This is the best movie I've seen this year, but I think that is understating how good it is."
6,"Disney's sharp with Moana is increasing to make it come to the point where this movie can't even be enjoyed completely what it should've been expected. Dwayne Johnson tries his very best in his sudden appearance, but he tries a little off the scale. Comparing this to Disney's previous installment, this intends to be a letdown and it did."
4,"I don't know what film the critics saw given the superlative reviews on here, but Moana was the most disappointing Disney film in a long time. The story was, frankly boring, and still managed to be difficult to follow for kids and the parents who, when asked, 'why did she do that?' had to say 'no idea'. Why did she keep falling in the water? Who knows? Was it supposed to be funny? Who knows?Moana's a pretty generic Disney princess heroine (despite the fact she is, to differentiate her from every other Disney princess heroine, only the daughter of a chief), full of moxie (as per usual Disney princess heroine) who must do something to save her island.. or learn something about herself.. or.. I'm not sure!The Rock is marginally amusing as the comic relief. He isn't helped by the dumb jokes he's given. The young actress voicing Moana does her best but isn't noteworthy (I think she was a non-professional and it shows.. or is heard).Lin-Manuel Miranda, who has done such a majestic job with Hamilton, hasn't done himself proud here. The songs just drag on. One song is the chirpy 'You're Welcome' sung by the Rock. It's catchy if nothing else.Frozen's a hard act for a Disney musical to follow, but Moana doesn't even try."
9,"Moana (November 2016) is the latest Walt Disney Animation Studios movie following up the extremely clever and fun Zootopia (March 2016) and the record breaking animated movie Finding Dory from Disney/Pixar (June 2016).  Moana is a CG animated film which takes place on a South Pacific island about a young girl named Moana, played by newcomer Aulii Cravalho, who longs to explore the ocean but is forbidden to leave as a result of her overprotective father who is also the Chief.  To make matters worse, Moanas Grandmother tells stories to the children of a demigod named Maui (played by Dwayne Johnson) who can change shape and experience wonders of the great sea which are all just out of reach from those stuck on the island.Moana features catchy songs and fantastic animation in addition to a well crafted story that feels both ancient and modern at the same time.  Moana and Maui have excellent chemistry on screen and both Cravalho and Johnson surprised us with their ability to convey humor, emotion and song with their voices.  We were glad to see a female protagonist introduced into the Disney universe who wasnt part of a love interest or even have a love interest at all  unless you count a love for her people and the ocean.  The movie also does a nice job of conveying Polynesian/Samoan culture and even has a couple of catchy songs sung in Traditional Tokelauan.Overall, Moana is enjoyable and fun to watch  if there was a negative side about the movie it would be that much time is spent with the two characters on a raft and reminded us a bit of the Kevin Costner movie Waterworld.  We would have liked to have seen a secondary plot that may have kept us involved for the rollercoaster ride and maybe even some explanation as to the significance of some of the cultural elements germane to the story."
9,"I don't remember the last time I enjoyed one hour and forty-three minutes, including opening and closing credits, as I did this afternoon watching 'Moana' (pronounced Mo-anha). I laughed out loud 2-3 times, which is pretty rare for me seeing a movie, and had a big smile on my face for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes while in the remaining time tears!There is so much to talk about while reviewing this film not least of all is the imaginative animation from the colors used, the many different characters, the variations of the sea btu most of all the expressions of each of the characters whether talking or not.Dwayne Johnson, just voted the sexiest man alive, the highest paid actor in the movies and the star of the successful HBO series 'Ballers' plays Maui and the drawing of his character, with animated tattoos all over his body, is fun in itself. Auli'i Cravalho debuts as Moana has a beautiful voice and plays the princess, though she insists she is not a princess as if that is a wrong thing to be. The banter, written by the screenwriter, Jared Bush, is not only fun but smart. Along with the two co-stars there is grandmother everyone would love to have voiced by Rachel House, the dumbest rooster you will ever see on the screen voiced by Alan Tudyk, Temuera Morrison as Moana's father, Jemaine Clement as a crab that has one of the many excellent songs, Nicole Scherzinger as Moana's mother, who is drawn too young looking more like her sister and my favorite, lovable creature, Puanani Cravalho as the pig!The songs are infectious, strong and one or two might show up as an Oscar nomination. They were written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, of 'Hamilton' fame, Mark Mancina and Samoan Opetaia Tavita Foa'i.The drawings and the animation of the characters are mind boggling as are the scenes on the ocean and islands.Treat yourself, and take a kid along if you would be too embarrassed going into seeing a 'cartoon' . Animated films of today are not like your parents or even you knew and these are also by Disney with a little/lot of help from Pixar!'Moana' is a delightful film that should seen by adults and kids of all ages!"

Absolutely amazing. I mean, what would you expect from Disney other than another 10/10. This ranks right up with Frozen and in my opinion, the best animated film of the year.
"
1,"Coming off of Frozen and Big Hero Six this was a huge disappointment. The story feels like it was made by the direct-to-video C Team. Where is John Lasseter when you need him? It was better than Chicken Little I suppose. Wait for video, rent it for $1 from red box or something. So sad about this, I wanted it to be great."
2,"Loved Frozen and seeing the reviews on here, figured Moana was a worthy follow up. I thought Zootopia was a great step forward for Disney. One step forward, two steps back. Moana's storyline is perfunctory so the film is full of padding with forgettable songs and repetitive action. It plays much more like a Disney straight to video than a theatrical release. The animation isn't even on par with recent Disney films. This is the first Disney film in a long time that isn't emotionally engaging. Dwight Johnson does his best with the jokey lines he's given, but nobody could save those jokes."

Songs were better, story was better, characters were better, action was better, and heroine was better. On the drive home I played the song 'Shiny' for my daughter. When she got home, she wanted to watch all the Moana stuff she could find on YouTube Kids. Read some reviews that parents didn't get it and couldn't explain it to their kids. So sad. Nothing to explain, nothing to not get. Great movie and fun for any person of any age.I would not mind going back and watching this with my daughter, even after just watching it on Black Friday."
0,"Moana is the name of a teenager who lives on her South Pacific island with her family. When the ocean calls to her, she sets out for an adventure where she teams up with a plucky demi-god (voiced by Dwayne Johnson). The story is pretty standard: full of positive empowerment for girls and culturally-appropriate references, but the beautiful animation and wondrous character design boost it's visual appeal. The inevitable sidekicks (a chicken and some tattoos) don't fall for the typical tropes and add another layer of delight. Toss in some catchy songs with typically-clever lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda (writer of 'Hamilton') and the experience is even more enjoyable. The lively pace and spunky attitude combine with beautiful animation to make this movie fresh and fun. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for one final amusement."
8,"Sorry little boys.  Another Disney movie means another Princess movie.  It seems that is all Disney makes anymore, but can you blame them?  'Frozen' made about a billion dollars world wide.  This latest Princess film follows the standard formula.  This time an Island Princess leaves home for an adventure (as opposed to leaving a castle, or tree top, etc).  The film looks great, has a few really good songs and a couple not so good, and some humor here and there (although not as funny as some other Princess films like 'Tangled').  It even boasts the world's stupidest chicken, although that schtick got old pretty quickly.  Moana's traveling companion, Maui, is the standard issue annoying character who fights Moana every step of the way, until the end of course.  Despite the lack of originality it is a well made film and I enjoyed it.  Boys will have to wait for Disney's competition to come up with another 'How to Train Your Dragon' or 'Kung Fu Panda' sequel to appeal to them and fill the void left by Disney."
5,"The first half of the movie was great and then it dragged on for the second half, with the story spiriling all over the place. I was in a theater full of children and at the halfway mark the movie lost them...they were getting up and running around and generally bored. They got back into it at the end. The animation was lovely but the story got too convoluted for children and it was too long. These kiddos were in the 7-10 range. That is my barometer for a children's movie and I always try to go and see them with an auditorium full of children. Also the music and lyrics were not very catch like you like in a Children's film. Disappointing."

0,"Moana is rich, colorful, lively, and full of spark. It is a good film, though it is not the best, most groundbreaking animated film. It's storytelling is generic with some slightly new twists. The music is good, but not heart wrenchingly powerful nor emotionally stirring. The animation is amazing, as expected. Moana herself is an endearing character, yet her story seems quite small and downplayed. However, it is Disney. It is, overall, a quality movie experience.P.S. I loved the chicken."

8,"Cross posted from my blog http://blog.nrajesh.com/moana-2016/Just as I am writing this, BBC News confirms that some parts of Hawaii are under three feet of snow. A study by NASA just confirms that 'it is no longer a question whether the West Antarctic Ice sheet will melt, it is a question of when'! In case you wonder what all this has to do with a Disney princess movie, read on...The story of Moana, while appearing as a brand new take of the Princess movie genre, is just an outfit for the 'naked ugly truth' that we all have come to digest. The story depicted is that of a voyage seeking adventurous girl, who needs to fight not just against the society (including her father), but also her own fears to go on an epic journey, to do something that everyone thinks is a fool's errand.Moana is not an ordinary girl though-she is the chosen one who can end the blight caused by the demigod Maui a millennia ago. A little back story is that Maui has stolen the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, and very soon he is felled by Te ka (an ash spewing lava monster). He also looses his 'hook', which gives him shape-shifting powers.The makers of the film have stuck to the usual sing and dance, rebellious princess with a comic little pet (a colourful chicken named Heihei). But what they portray even in the back story is very hard to ignore.What Maui represents is nothing more than the various species that rely on mother nature for survival. The 'human' who also happens to discover uses for things like fire or even simple products of nature (like a coconut), wanted to steal the core of mother nature (Te Fiti) for betterment of the lives of his brethren.In the end, even Maui exclaims that even though he stole and sought a piece of nature for fellow humans to claim their fond feelings, he always felt defeated because they always remained unsatisfied.The back story ends when the peaceful part of Te Fiti disappears. Ta Ka emerges. It is nothing more than one of the violent faces of mother nature.The story line apart, I found the visuals of this movie were an absolute treat. A special shout-out to the scenes where Moana and Maui interact with a giant crab named Tamatoa! The chase by the coconut-pirates was really creative. Even the mature audience are left teary eyes by the songs and dialogues (in general).All it took to plant the seed of undertaking this journey in Moana's mind, was the undying persuasion of her grandma (the crazy old woman of the village). Not surprisingly, the depletion of the food source simply put it in action. What saves it, at most times, is teamwork; and there is proof that even if your teammate is someone as helpless as a confused chicken, it will suffice. What finally does fulfil this epic quest is that singular attribute we humans manage to find even in our most trying times - a ray of hope!Moana is important NOT just because Disney redefined the very purpose of a princess story - from being just two hour fairy tales to tales conveying subtle messages for today's younger generation. If the kids don't seem to get it, please pitch in as a parent or a tutor.This movie IS significant because it manages to stir a belief in us that we seem to have long forgotten. It reminds that true redemption is to do that thing which our soul 'truly' seeks. It clarifies that we are all voyagers at heart and all we have to do is just set sail beyond the comfort zones of our conflicted minds. Do that and you can overcome even your most feared adversary. Do watch in theatres to give your little princes and princesses a great holiday treat!"
8,"The last film I saw in 2016 and the first film I have reviewed in 2017, Moana is a great finale for the year. Yet another kinetic and truly magical animated experience from Disney, Moana is a great combination of emotion, music, and mythology. With brilliantly composed music, infectious songs, great comedy, and lovely characterization, Moana is a showcase for the level of storytelling that Disney is able to churn out in its animated works. Between this, Zootopia, and Finding Dory, it was truly a banner year for the studio giant, both with its films and its box office receipts.Featuring all the Disney trademarks with a princess, a goofy and boisterous sidekick, animal sidekicks, restrictive parents, and dead relatives, Moana is a journey of self-discovery. With Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti in order to life the darkness that consumes her homeland, she must take demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) - who stole the heart - with her in order to complete the mission. A long and arduous journey, it is through this journey that the film reveals its ultimate moral: you must know who you are to know where you are going. While following your heart and inner compass are certainly other elements of Moana, none feature nearly as prominently as the portion that stands as the ultimate moral in my eyes. There are repeated references to this moral throughout and the song, 'How Far I'll Go' - also the most prominent song on the soundtrack and the one that begins to play during the credits - is very much about this moral as well. The mythology of Moana's people supports this as well, as they were once voyagers. As shown in a flashback song, the voyagers kept a sharp eye out for where they were going, largely based upon where they had been and where home was located. This can be adjusted for everybody in the audience by simply stating: follow your dreams by knowing where you were and using it to help you get where you want to be. As is typical, this is a great message for children and adults alike.Using magical-looking blues and purples throughout, the film is incredibly vibrant. With large and impeccably animated musical set pieces alongside these gorgeous visuals (especially those with the sting ray), Moana is a feast for the sense. Your eyes will love it and so will your ears. The visuals and the music are constantly in great harmony. The visuals are certainly bolstered by the excellent animation that, on one watch, had no noticeable flaws. At all times, the film utilized its animation to create fun and interesting visuals that will undoubtedly keep kids engaged and not annoy parents, even with its incredible vibrancy. The music, with great melodies and tunes influenced by its location, is tremendous. Though not the best music of the year (La La Land), Moana is a film that certainly packs a punch with emotional, compelling, and wonderfully composed/written music. Some have said that the music is forgettable, but I found it to be anything but with songs such as 'How Far I'll Go' certain to find a home in my Spotify.The story, if simplistic, is still packed with emotion and comedy. From the great stupid chicken to provide comic relief to the dead relatives to deliver the pathos, Moana is a film that plays with your emotions. It is capable of making you laugh one second and hold back tears the next. This is a balance that the very best Disney animated movies can create and it is one that Moana excels in harnessing. Though it is obviously manipulative at times, the sight of the stingray never made me not well up, so clearly it was incredibly effective with the manipulation. The film is also incredibly adept at balancing the music, the comedy, and plot. Though the plot is, again, simplistic, it is still engaging. Serious moments of adventure or mythology are never interrupted by comedy from the chicken or out of place musical moments. Each element has its place and Moana is able to balance the trio. Given the inclinations of another Disney property (Marvel) to inject humor in all serious moments, I feared this one would fall into the same traps, but it never took the bait. Instead, it waited for the serious moments to play out and then it introduced the comedy. By picking its spots with the comedic relief, the comedy always feels fresh and, well, funny.An incredible work by Disney Animation, Moana shows that the mega studio still has what it takes to create wonderful stories about Princesses, big brutes, and dead relatives. Though it sticks to the formula very closely, it is always engaging, moving, and funny, so that is more than enough for me. In 20 years, Moana will likely be cited alongside Frozen as the 'classics' for the kids of today."
8,"What a joy! Moana is one of the most entertaining films of the whole year thanks to it's fun characters, brilliant animation, great voice acting and outstanding music that'll have you singing and humming long after the film is over. It is your typical hero journey with a lot of familiar beats, but it's execution raises it above familiarity. One of Disney's best in recent years."

In the long line of Disney Princess films Moana distinguishes itself with a new setting and by speaking to lineage and importance of tradition and finding your calling. A-

8,"I'm a father, just took my 6 year old boy and 8 year old girl to see this, and they both loved it. I also enjoyed it a lot. Disney is usually good at making 'family' movies, instead of 'kids' movies. I think Moana is something people of all ages will enjoy. The songs are catchy, the story is exciting, the animation is beautiful, and the characters are inspiring. I didn't give this a full 10 because I felt there were a few pacing issues and one scene involving a giant crab that felt tonally out of place, but otherwise a solid movie. Go see this in theaters, it's worth it to see on the big screen."
10,"The best Disney animated film since Pocahontas, The Lion King and Hercules. The soundtrack is splendid and reminisce of Disney classics. What sets the movie apart is that the film revolves about finding oneself and main character doesn't rely on others but her willingness and strength to reach her goal. Lin-Manuel Miranda a great lyricist and producer."
7,"A fun, dazzling, pretty to look at, albeit predictable and formulaic effort from Disney. While the voice talent from Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho was perfectly suited and like I said, the film had gorgeous animation throughout, the setup of the story was simply too formulaic and predictable throughout for my liking. I always found myself knowing what was likely gonna happen next and the film really took no risks or tried anything new in terms of the plot and main conflict. Overall, it's a fun little film while it lasts but I really didn't find myself loving it like most did. Simply put, I thought it was good not great and Disney has certainly impressed me far more with some of their other films, like Zootopia from earlier this year for example."
10,"At first glance, I thought that this film was going to be something similar to Frozen. A title that was good at one viewing but got annoying due to it's immense popularity. I thoroughly enjoyed Moana, the chemistry and charisma that exudes between the two leads makes even more enjoyable.The CGI and animation was wonderful plus the soundtrack was a delight as well. It also has enough humor to appease all ages and I would go as far to say that its a film worth seeing for all ages."
10,"Related media: There are no media related to this film. I am also not familiar with Hawaiian/Polynesian stories/myths/religions.What's it like?: It is like a couple of films in the past where the elders try to prevent their child/children from venturing out of their village/town for fear of the evils/nastiness of the world outside of the village/town. The Village is one such example. Pros:1. It is a good as Frozen, but has more realism, but see Cons # 1.2. It is very beautiful, particularly the parts showing the movement of water and on scene with many colours. Frozen did not look as good in this area.3. This film introduces some aspects of Hawaiian/Polynesian stories/myths/religions, and that's fun to watch.  4. There are some nice original songs.5. There is a nice twist at the end.Cons: 1. There are many parts that deal with magic and spirits, which lessen the realism.How would the the different age groups rate it?Children: Excellent.Teens: Excellent.Young adults: GoodMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: Excellent.My rating: 5/5 (no half scores). It's worth it to watch it in the cinemas and then buy the DVDs."
7,"Despite its strange homage to Mad Max Fury Road placed to set up clearly the role and band of the co-protagonist, Moana is a surprisingly sound tale build from fragments of several tales common to the Pacific cultures. A strong similarity with the Deer God duality from Miyazaki's Mononoke Hime at the end of the film is unsurprising because of the shared folk tales used as source. With two skippable musical scenes, this is the very best animated film from Disney since Up."
8,"This highly anticipated film is an enjoyable one that is utterly predictable and too long. The visual design is stunning, and there are some brilliant sequences, but the pacing and endless exposition mean that, at around two hours, it's unnecessarily long for the story to be appreciated. Whilst the performances are good, the soundtrack is one which is somewhat bland for a Disney film; catchy tunes, forgettable lyrics. A nice family film overall, but not one of Disney's best. 7.76/10A special mention, however, must go to the brilliant Inner Workings, which is worth the price of admission on its own. Funny and poignant, this is a superb short film delightfully executed. 9.23/10"
9,"A Seesaw of Dissimilar Components'Moana' is the 56th Disney animated feature film after 'Zootopia', at the beginning of the year. Directed with atticism, harmony and deep deferences by the Polynesian culture by seasoned pair-director John Musker and Ron Clements, the newest treasure of the factory follows Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), a brave young falling in love with wonders in the ocean. She lives accompanied by her sensitive mother Sina (Nicole Scherzinger), her over-protective father Tui (Temuera Morrison) and her former navigator tribe in the radiant island of Motunuilocated in the most westerly place in Chile, in life real, they have lodged there once a nautical misfortune caused absolute cease of their trips on the sea. However, Mother Nature seems to annihilate crops and imposing beauties in which they live, by which, Moana is driven to set sail in search of Maui ('The Rock')the demigod who stole the precious stone from the heart of nature, for giving back the beautiful gem to its home, causing the growth of needy groceries and nature. As is recurrent in the films of the study, Clements and Musker's road movie/ buddy movie will place the duo protagonist in more than one risky and brilliant adventure, forging naturally a spontaneous and classic friendship. What most stands out here is that we don't have a 'Princess' itselfeven so she proceed from powerful parents,we don't have a woman of small waist, albino skin, silky hair, there is also no stepmothers or perfidious witches, there are no enchanted castles; however, the best is there's no love interest, quite the contrary, we have an essential story of female emancipation, maturity, and fellowship.Like the best Disney movies, 'Moana' is electrifying in its traditionalism. From the first moment to the last, the film is a profusion of vividness, verism, and buoyant pictures, reaching optic magnetism that got 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Good Dinosaur'. The textures, looks, styles, volumes and dimensions of each well-prepared features are the real links allowing to bring the story with raging incentive from adult or child audience. Ocean's lifethe water is one of the characters more complicated of conceiving in computer-animated fantasy films,marine flora and faunaalthough they are not too visible, What we watched is impressive, greenish environment of the island, the crafted visuals to Polynesian culture, Moana's curls, Maui's tattoos, everything, everything absolutely has a beautiful extravagance visual. If it were for its realistic images, this would be an instant masterpiece.The Achilles' heel comes from its screenplay written by the vast crew members (8 screenwriters). Because, the story has been related incessantly in previous animated projects; this time, it is the same essence merged into radiant pictures and even though she is the most distant in princess movies, it does not save to feel repetitive. Throughout the feature film, the effortand the lassitudeis remarkable since they wished to have original and entertaining situations, such as the descent into the monsters world, nevertheless, trivialities of the genre are palpable. Rather than palpable are its grueling referencesno, we are not talking about the 'easter eggs', and by the way, I only caught one: Sven from 'Frozen',the selfsame directors confessed using even some of the material from their prior works. References from the apocalyptic 'Mad Max' by George Miller to the vibrant 'Mulan' by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook.This is the best original motion picture soundtrack of Disney in years. Which is led by American actor and writer Lin-Manuel Miranda, who has monopolized lately the public points of attraction starring and creating in the Broadway musicals 'In the Heights' and 'Hamilton'especially by this last one. Although, many English-speaking viewers attended to movie theaters for seeing 'Moana' for two reasons primarilyleaving most important aspects aside: the first one, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who lends his voice to Maui and the second one, by acclaimed Miranda's compositions. It would not be a surprise to see coming nominations at full speed for such great achievement, simply beautiful.'Moana' from Disney is a delightful journey to open ocean, it is inquisitively a rigorous work. Our aural and optical receivers will experience an unimaginable wonders feast, nonetheless, its narrative and treatment are not at the same level than artistic area. There is no doubt that kids and adult going to enjoy the adventures of the new and less conventional Disney princess, and although the factory is trying to break slowly modern community's unshakable taboos, there's still a long way to go. Disney, thanks for providing pure films, however, they can always be improved further, and they have extravagant opportunities here."

I really enjoyed Moana.  Some of the songs are still in my head days later (and I mean this in a positive way), and the animation and settings were beautiful.  I generally enjoyed the sense of humor, and the story was exciting and optimistic.
"
9,"It's when the year is finishing and Disney is still surprising us. Moana is not just the best animated movie of the year, it will have been a classic by some more years. It's delightful, unique and a bit better than Zootopia (and FAR better than Frozen). The musical and the animation is gorgeous and pure gold, I still don't get it why so much hate to this movie... (91%)"
8,"Compared to other disney movies over the recent years Moana has the highest comedic value with punchlines and jokes around every corner. The animation is excellent; although for a disney movie this is to be expected. The songs are a big part of this movie and were sung beautifully. The core story-line of Moana is simple yet it is engaging. The underlying story, motivations and reasons however bring a lot of questions; especially when it is thought over after the movie ends. Moana is a great disney movie especially for those who watch it purely for enjoyment and laughs. However if one is looking for a well thought out story Moana lacks in comparison to recent disney movies such as Big Hero 6, Inside Out or Zootopia."

Once again pixar gets it done right with another great animated film. While it's not a classic, it's better than finding dory. The movie can be predictable and cliche at times, but it's still a fun movie.

Moana's wonderful animation; entertainning and exhilarating story-telling and its unforgettable character (Maui), this gorgeous film becomes one of Disney's most important animated classics.
"
8,"'Moana' was as fun and light-hearted as I could have wanted. A truly entertaining piece brought to us by Disney but who could have honestly expected anything different? Before getting into anything else, I have to first bring focus to how beautiful this movie is. The animation is so perfect and wonderfully done that I had moments where I forgot I was watching an animated film. From the models themselves, to the water effects, to the simplest motions. This was a truly beautiful movie to witness... 'Moana' also was very fluid and entertaining from start to finish. I never sat bored or felt rushed, it was a smooth and easy film to follow. Entertaining for the youngest of watchers to the most seasoned movie goer... Lastly, what is a Disney follow up movie to 'Frozen' without a little music? The singing pieces within this film was also a bunch of fun to experience. Although I can see other viewers getting annoyed or tired of the music but you come to expect that going into a Disney movie like 'Moana'. I personally enjoyed Dwayne's song 'You're Welcome' but of course, I am a bit biased when it comes to anything Dwayne.There is not much else I can say beyond what is already said. It is another animated Disney movie, but a brilliantly done one at that. 'Moana' is a film for all to love and is well deserving of all the kinds of praise it has been getting in recent weeks. Keep an eye out for this one in the future as well for the coming Oscars season.--Oberrated--"
7,"Long story short, Moana was nowhere near as good as Zootopia was, but still nice. The songs were great, the animation was some of the finest computer animation that I had ever seen, and the characters were enjoyable. However, what held it back was the story. The story was very predictable, simplistic, and the side characters weren't interesting."
10,"This is arguably one of if not the best movie Disney has made in years (and with how good their films usually are, this is saying a lot).To start, the movie has a very enjoyable story. It has an overall simple plot, but the story takes the main characters to many different places with many cool characters and enemies. The movie constantly ups the stakes with every encounter which makes it that much more exciting.The voice acting is fantastic as well, as are the singing. Most of the songs will be classics someday, and the main one is just as catchy as 'Let it Go'. The movie also looks beautiful visually as well.Overall, Moana is a fantastic film that I am glad I saw. I would say this is a must see for any fan of animation, Disney or overall good movies."

Great music, great writing, great voice acting, great characters, al, around great, but the number 1 reason I payed money for this movie, is moana is suuuuuuper sexy
"
8,"Whats it about?A Polynesian princess yearns for the open sea and when her island begins to die she embraces the opportunity to seek out the help of the demigod Maui and insist that he return the heart of the world.What did I think?The stories of ancient tribal cultures tend to get lost in the flash and glitz of 21st-century storytelling but Disney has a lot of skill redrafting old tales. Moana is exceptional cinema. Lavish scenes, vibrant heartfelt characters, and joyous songs combine in that Disney style to share the tales of another whole new world.Like all of the Disney products, there is a sprinkling of shoehorned emotional moments that could have hit the cutting room floor but, in total, its entirely satisfying. Im still humming the songs and counting down the days until I can see it again."
9,"Great movie. My four year old daughter loved it. I enjoyed it way more than Frozen (father writing this). Songs were better, story was better, characters were better, action was better, and heroine was better. On the drive home I played the song 'Shiny' for my daughter. When she got home, she wanted to watch all the Moana stuff she could find on YouTube Kids.  Read some reviews that parents didn't get it and couldn't explain it to their kids. So sad. Nothing to explain, nothing to not get. Great movie and fun for any person of any age.I would not mind going back and watching this with my daughter, even after just watching it on Black Friday."
7,"Faithful to the tradition of Disneys renaissance era, Moana takes audiences of all ages on a journey with a resourceful young woman who learns her place in the world. Parents will love the tribute toward Polynesian culture, while kids will love the fantastical journey made complete with a fresh color palette. Other than an inappropriately placed gag about urination, Moana has established itself as yet another family-friendly hit by the Disney studio within their CGI renaissance.The wide range of animation styles explored here starts with a two-dimensional storytelling of what Polynesian religion believes brought the islands into existence. In what appears to be a moving tapestry, a wise, grandmotherly voiceover tells us of Mother Island, who raised islands out of the sea and then rested among them. That is, until Maui the shapeshifting demigod stole her heart. Along his path away from Mother Island, he lost the heart, as well as his fish hook that allows him to shapeshift.Then the animation style switches to the traditional computer animation, where an elderly storyteller is speaking to her grandchildren about the story. The one seated in the middle of the pack, the heroine of our story, immediately goes out onto the seashore, where the miraculously animated living water leads her through conch shells to the heart of Mother Island itself: the ocean called her to restore peace to the land.Then this toddler grows up to become Moana, daughter of the chief who wishes to sway away from their traditional ways in order to explore the world. Shes a typical kids movie heroine weve seen countless times before, and her motive to defy authority is not a good message for our kids, but the empowering musical voice by Auli'i Cravalho plenty makes up for that.Her grandmother pushes her to follow the calling by the ocean to find Maui the demigod so that she can help him retrieve his fish hook and return the heart to Mother Island. It follows out of the tradition followed by her people, as they are not voyagers; but their long-forgotten ancestry says otherwise. Therefore, Moana goes out on the quest, with a google-eyed, dim-witted chicken as her sole companion.Then she meets Maui himself, voiced with a lovable laid-back nature by Dwayne Johnson. He adds the familiar heart and soul expected from any Disney feature, as his tattoos move individually to express his true feelings.Now with the demigod on her voyage, Moana travels elsewhere to find his hook and get to Mother Island. Such stops include an underwater world of fantasy that houses a giant gold-crazy hermit crab. He is not one of the more tolerable portions of the adventure though, as his modes of dialogue includes rambling without a clear punchline to whatever joke hes attempting to deliver, and an out of place song sung in the style of Paul McCartney.This is among one of the other songs that simply sound odd in melody. Even so, there are several hits in the score, including Moanas single ballad, How Far I'll Go, and the catchy We Know the Way, both of which are guaranteed Oscar nominations. Yet none of these songs will catch on as one of Disneys iconic tunes. In addition, anytime the characters are not singing, they are blatantly telling us through not-so-subtle foreshadowing what will happen later on.Another thing that is difficult to grasp about Moana is the big so what of its celebration towards pagan religion. While yes, we should never be afraid to learn about other cultures and their backgrounds, depicting their gods as truth is not the answer to learning about who these people are. I would like for Disney to someday make a big leap in exploring and faithfully retelling the way those of another culture live their day to day lives, as to make up for their poor treatment of non-White races in the past.I cannot see Moana becoming a celebrated classic like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or The Little Mermaid, nor can I see it largely influencing pop culture like Frozen or Zootopia, but it is still a fresh adventure for the young and young at heart to get the ideal expected Disney experience."

It's a good movie which probably will make you laugh once or twice. It's a fantasy movie which does everything right. You should watch this movie just once.

9,"~ Disney Crafts a Cinematic Gem ~To transverse the world in which Moana takes place is undoubtedly an experience of blissful joy. The films directors (John Musker, Ron Clements) and its animators have constructed the South Pacific in a rather elegant manner  oceans appear almost life-like in color / clarity and the islands themselves are a hypnotic lush green. The byproduct of this polished look is an Island that enthralls the viewer; you feel compelled to plunge amidst this gorgeous world and experience first-hand its bright palette. This in of itself is the magic behind Disney: a superimposed prettiness paralleled with a charming narrative.Seasoned Disney directors John Musker and Ron Clements (The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules) adhere to an already established blueprint: we have a three-dimensional protagonist (Moana) whose overt wanderlust impels her to adventure beyond her Polynesian village in spite of her fathers overprotective nature. Interesting plot developments are made as we see the relationship between Moana and the pretentious demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) evolve. The narrative advances like the typical heros journey  unique in that we have a teen heroine sans a love interest. Moana consistently hits the mark in that its story is entirely revolved around its heroine  a headstrong Polynesian girl who is unapologetically herself. With Moana, Disney finds itself once again a juggernaut in the world of film."
9,"Moana is an enchanting disney movie in this year, though maybe people will prefer Zootopia than this. But, I don't watch Zootopia and other disney movies that released this year. The story is simply powerful, also the colorful characters. The scenery of the ocean is visually stunning, I could never imagine if I were in this movie. Really."
3,"This movie is pointless. The entire movie revolves around her beating Te Ka, aka a lava monster, in order to return the stone, but this goal could have been so easily achieved. Moana was loved by the ocean, and during the entire movie, all I was thinking was, 'Couldn't the ocean just automatically take her to where they were suppose to go, since it was able to do that for her in Maui's case? Could't the ocean just defeat the lava monster, since it was unable to touch the water? If the ocean was able to make a pathway of water in the end scene, then why couldn't it help moana earlier?' I realize that it would defeat the purpose of the ending part with the volcano being the goddess, but throughout the entire movie I kept thinking that the movie's entire conflict could have been solved very very easily, so what was the point of prolonging it for so long?"
7,"This movie is Disney-Princess clich after Disney-Princess clich. Special girl with cool powers? Check. Dumb/friendly animal sidekick? Check. Awesome strong sidekick? Check. Story about discovering yourself/ love/ whatever? Check. Audience humor (humor that is dumb enough for dumb audience members)? Check.This is no surprise of course; this is the same team of directors behind every Disney movie ever (hyperbole). However, this movie is lifted by smooth animation (especially those tattoos that were traditionally animated), creative  sequences, an awesome soundtrack, nice voice-work, and the general backgrounds and settings that carry the film. All of these elements elevate this dumb, lazy, and boring movie (in terms of the writing and direction) enough that it is good.It's also better than Frozen if you're worrying about that."
7,"'Passengers' is a perfect example of star power plus chemistry between the two leads making a so-so movie much better. Yes the CGI effects are, at points, amazing and/or amusing--anyone for an android bartender?-- but the basic story of 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl'--do I really have to add the third part?--is as old as the movies are but Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt give the film that extra something that makes the story almost seem new. They bring something to 'Passengers' that sort of makes up the lack of chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard that almost made 'Allied' impossible to look at!The story avoids many moral issues brought up by the basis of the relationship between the two stars but one sort of forgets that aspect watching Lawrence and Pratt on a 120 year trip to a new world where 5,000 passengers, plus a crew of over 200, are put in hibernation for the trip with plans to wake them up 4 months before they reach Homestead II. In a case of malfunction Pratt wakes up 90 years ahead of schedule and due to a lie Lawrence wakes up a year later soon to be followed by a crew member, played Lawrence Fishburne, by another malfunction.Though familiar, establishing the romance between the working class mechanical engineer and the Gold Class passenger, which seems to get her a better choice of foods and coffee selection, is delightful as they romp around the space ship Avalon with all the luxuries. I doubt any other woman in space will have the hair, makeup and various outfits as given to Lawrence. There are three scenes in the infinity pool that range from fun to horror to a romantic spot. When the android bartender, played by Martin Sheen, accidentally gives away a betrayal taken place, the chemistry and heat goes up a couple of notches between Jim (Pratt) and Aurora (Lawrence) in their anger and disappointment in each other.While 'Passengers' may seem like a run of the mill sci-fi and/or love story picture Lawrence, Pratt and many interesting special effects holds more interest then a usual space film does. Could you wait 50 years for a reply for help? Time is also played with in the film.Fishburne's role is small but effective and necessary, Sheen provides a few laughs and, surprisingly, so do the robotic vacuum cleaners, plus Andy Garcia is listed in the credits but I don't recall seeing him in the film.Morten Tyldum, the director, and screen writer Jon Spaihts, offer the sci-fi aspects a lot better than the romantic angles but in the more than capable hands of Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt the latter part offers all a romance, the good and bad, should. Tyldum and Spaihts could have added a third dimension to the movie by getting into suspending life for 120 years and some of the ethical discussions that are brought up.Though not a 'must see' film those who are fans of Jennifer Lawrence or are not familiar with Chris Pratt plus the production design of the space ship Avalon by Guy Hendrix Dyass are reasons enough to see 'Passengers'."
4,"Passengers features fantastic production design and impressive visual effects. However, this is a romance film. And the romance between Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence was hit and miss. You care about the couple at parts, and since the whole film is riding on this it really sinks the whole thing as the film doesn't fully deliver what it sets out to achieve. Add this to the list of disappointments in 2016."
7,"I thought it deserved better than the ratings I see so, I'm writing my first movie review. My early baby boomer generation would have rated it higher. We liked love stories with a twist and a good ending. Talented and compatible actors complimented each other. Could see them working together again."
7,"At last I've found a really decent SciFi Hollywood movie. To be frank I can't remember when it was last time I saw a quality science fiction film. Until now. Either them were boring or pretentious or, in case of 'Interstellar' a bad, melodramatic rip-off of Paul Anderson's story 'Kyrie'. But this one, the 'Passengers' has returned my hope that SciFi movie genre is not dead and there are still good directors and screenwriters in completely 'Lucasized' Hollywood.You'll found no stupid killings or preachy here. You'll find no sound in space either. No 'star wars' rubbish. And You'll disagree with the main hero - he is weak, egoistic man. But still. All of us have a chance to repent. The ways of God are mysterious. And maybe some of us must follow our destiny regardless of circumstances. Yep, the film will provoke you to think about some things. At least some of you :) And that is what makes SciFi great - to show how human remain human in an inhuman conditions. To conduct mental experiments about our moral and integrity. Nice movie indeed."
10,"This is one of the better Sci-Fi film ever made. Although it is a character driven space drama, and a romance film in moments, the main theme of this film is about the moral dilemmas of a modern Robinson Crusoe, alone because of an accident and trapped in an ethical dilemma. To stay alone, or to awaken a companion from amongst the other 5000 passengers - all trapped in stasis for the next 90 years.I truly can't understand how the reviewers were so negative with this film. They do moviegoers a massive disservice by proclaiming in loud and stupid voices that it's unenjoyable, boring or flawed.Chemistry between the actors was great, with the relationship playing out with a conscious awareness of their eventual fate and the fear that goes along with it.For me, I found it exciting, fun and well developed. The characters behave in sync with their narrative, evoking emotion from a number of well constructed and developed situations which crop up to disturb the slow pacing.The writing was exceptional. Of all the pinches in film narrative, this has one of the best, as Martin Sheen delivers one line to throw the course of the protagonists story into a chaotic turmoil. Excellent.The science is mostly there, and there is little deviation (excepting some interesting gravitics) from what could happen given believable advancements in engineering and innovation. There was a slight disconnect as a thermal vent was opened, but this was mitigated somewhat by the emotion of the moment.All in all, I can't see what people are complaining about. Far better developed than Force Awakens, more character driven than Interstellar, and less idiotic than Gravity.One of the best movies of the year.I think the critics were after another story where they get to see mass devastation, demagoguery or a clear cut line between good and evil. This kind of juvenile journalism is the reason why critic reviews are falling out of favor in the more mainstream circles. People simply can't trust these people to deliver honest or heartfelt reviews anymore. They have become corporate shills who jump a bandwagon and team up to attack due to internal group dynamics.Today Critical reviews are largely inverse to my enjoyment of a film. I continue to be pleased when they review a blockbuster release poorly."
9,"Very beautifully presented, with a very solid acting, humour packed love story. Yup, that's what it is. Space love story. Special notice to Chris Pratt - wow, wasn't expecting how versatile this actor is. From now on I'll be sure to check anything this guy gonna take part in.  Although the movie is quite 'light' itself, it touches a few questions of moral choices. Once again I am very surprised by critics reaction because it is a very good choice of a movie to see on a holiday season. It is just a very good choice of a movie to see."
10,"This was an amazing piece of art that was also so truly romantic. While I understand it will not appeal to much of the audience who is looking for meaningless violence and bullets flying everywhere this movie has an incredibly deep touch of the human mind and soul, looking within ourselves and trying to define concepts that transcend time and distance all wrapped in a space opera rendered in extraordinary colors.I was so surprised to see this type of movie that goes into the rich and amazing ideas of old giants of sci-fi writers such as Stanislav Lem or Asimov. It all reminded me of a very old book from my childhood called 'Magellanic cloud' by Stanislav Lem.I have been connected with this movie on so many levels as this story depicts the human soul in all its loneliness, craving for companionship in the vast empty void of space.It more than exceeded my expectations and it's a solid 10 for me, absolutely no hesitations."
8,"Passengers features the idea of having a world where the earth is overpopulated and this compells a company called homestead to transfer people to a different planet. I think the movie gives us an idea of how our future will turn out. I plot was extremely unpredictable and unrealistic so that's something the movie could've worked on to be honest."
9,"We went into Passengers expecting little in story or entertainment value, especially considering the ravaging the critics have given it.  What we found was for the most part a well constructed desert island tale and one person's struggle to survive and to maintain his sanity.  (small spoiler warning)Jim's selection of Aurora as the person he eventually awoke wasn't predatory, but a random selection from his effort to clean up a bottle hurled in a rage at his loneliness. The fact that the suspended animation chamber contained a beautiful woman was an unplanned benefit.  (end of spoiler) The reason for the various equipment failures was boiled down to something serious and unexpected by the designers.  The 'evil' corporation that built the ship had covered everything except to trigger an awakening sequence for some of the crew and a total lack of hibernation equipment.  The last point is what kicks this into real romance movie territory.  The final scene took a minute to make sense but illustrated Jim's desire to give someone he loved what he'd dreamed of building.   My suggestion is to go into this movie looking for a couple of hours of light entertainment and good special effects and be pleasantly surprised. BTW, I'd sure as hell not want to be in Jennifer Lawrence's line of fire if she got seriously angry.  Her rage was awesome!"

8,"Ignore the critics' reviews.  This is a good movie.  It's thought-provoking as well as entertaining.  Even my husband (who is not a sci-fi fan) enjoyed the movie. Pratt and Lawrence have incredible chemistry, and they really sell this story. I was impressed with the set design, the unique storyline, and the strong acting.  The story touched my heart and gave me lots to think about after the movie was over."
9,"We start off with spaceship Avalon travelling through space on the way to Homestead II, a new colony that gives people from Earth the opportunity to get away from the overcrowded planet. There are five thousand passengers and 258 crew on board, all sleeping in hibernation pods. About thirty years into the journey the Avalon is hit by a massive astroid field and sustains some damage. Most of the damage is not visible straight away, but will prove to be crucial later on.Unfortunately for mechanic Jim Preston this incident results in his hibernation pod malfunctioning. He wakes up and soon realises that something is way off. For the next year he lives on this spaceship all by himself amongst thousands of sleeping people. At first he keeps himself busy with various tasks around the ship. Slowly the loneliness is getting to him though. His only companion is a bar tender android, played by Michael Sheen who is brilliant in the role. His performance quite outshines Chris Pratt, I hate to say.Jim sinks into a deep depression and even contemplates suicide. He faces isolation and loneliness literally for the rest of his life. And that amongst of a sea of people. The spaceship will only arrive at the homestead in ninety years. Well after he will have died. During a particularly dark time he comes upon the pod of Aurora Lane. He is intrigued and starts reading up on her. The more he learns the more he fancies himself in love with her.The next part has been called many things all over the internet from dark to selfish to downright murder. And perhaps that is all true. But I challenge anyone of those people to deny that they would not have sought a companion and done the same thing. If you faced spending the rest of your life without contact to another person ever again, surely that would makes anyone try and find a solution.After months of trying to talk himself out of it he tampers with Auroras hibernation pod and wakes her up. In the beginning she believes that her awaking is also due to a pod failure. She is not happy about it but once she realises that there is no going back she settles into life on the ship.Before too long all of Jims dreams come true and they become an item. The bar tender has now two clients. Life is good for a while. Jim and Aurora are happy. Her travel gold member status gives them access to all kinds of perks on the ship.As to be expected the truth comes out eventually and the romance comes to an abrupt stand still. At first Aurora is shocked and enraged when she finds out that she is stuck on the ship for the rest of her life. Then she blocks Christ and gives him the silent treatment. Her reaction is quite understandable considering that someone else altered the course of her life for his own selfish reasons. Jim sentences her to a life on the spaceship without her own choosing.By then the technical incidents on board add up and a third person wakes up, this time one of the crew. Gus is the Chief Deck Officer of the Avalon. Together they discover that the nuclear power plant is overheating. The malfunctioning of the ship gets worse, threatening to end in disaster for all on board.Gus awakening has unexpected and deadly side effects and soon Aurora and Jim find themselves alone again, racing against time to safe the spaceship and everyone on it. They are forced to work together to survive. During the attempts to cool down the power plant, Jim leaves the ship for a dangerous spacewalk that could mean his death. Aurora realises that without him she would be in exactly the same position as he was before waking her up. She realises how she loves him and how very much she does not want to be alone either.There are a few tense moments, but in the end they make it. When the crew wakes up eighty eight years later they find the space ship partly transformed into a giant greenhouse. Jim and Aurora learned a valuable lesson, as hopefully will have the viewer. People are always on the way somewhere, instead of living in the moment. They want to be somewhere else, instead of being happy where they are with the people in their lives.In the end, was it murder to wake up Aurora? I don't think so. She and Jim lived a long and happy live. They made the best of their circumstances and grew old together. What more could you possibly want from life? Does it really matter where you are as long as you are loved and happy?I found it fascinating that the entire movie was basically held by only three people, Jenifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt and Michael Sheen. Jennifer Lawrence is such an amazing actress. Her characters reaction when she found out the truth was spectacular to say the least.Chris Pratt started out as this happy go lucky guy who sank into despair at the prospects ahead of him. It was a great performance on his part.Only Michael Sheen could play a legless android in such a manner. I was once again so impressed by him. He is a wonderful actor.Overall I really enjoyed Passengers."
8,"Passengers is a thoughtful movie about a future where man is sending out giant passenger vessels to colonize new worlds. The action is enthralling but not fast paced - so it may too slow for some people. The plot seems plausible, however, and the characters believable. The ending is subject to interpretation and I personally think it's a 'reboot' of Adam and Eve, and the garden Eden."

Great story about important things, important choices and importance of enjoying your life.It's not so much about science, it's more about love, humans, life and beauty.

7,"Not really understanding the hate being thrown at this movie. From what I can tell the main criticism is that that the plot didn't have enough twist and turns. Really, every movie doesn't have to be that sort of film. It's a very simple story to follow and presents the viewers with compelling moral dilemmas. I personally enjoy sci-if isolation movies, so the premise of the movie already interested me. It isn't an epic film, but I never lost interest the whole way through."
8,"Chris Pratt flexes his leading man muscles (literally and figuratively) as a mechanic who finds himself awake on a spaceship before it reaches its new planet90 years too soon! Jennifer Lawrence plays the woman who shares this unfortunate accident and they set out to determine what changed their fate. Their plight manages to maintain interest and the futuristic design adds a layer of cool. Even though their chemistry is fine, this is really Pratt's movie: he beautifully manages to capture the confusion, longing, desperation and other emotions that plague his plight. Even though some of the plot elements give way to traditional Hollywood structure, the whole adventure is packaged in a wondrous sci-fi world that makes it fun to explore."
9,"The trailer of this movie were made in a bit misleading way. I gave them 9 out of 10 for successfully doing this (it misleading in a good way, similar like the trailer of horror movie The Boy). I mean the actors / actres, CGI effect, and story was just out of the question for both inspiring and mind blowing. Some people might say that the story is too simple, but it was never about how simple or complex the story if you were presented with so many fundamental moral & etiquette questions (take a look the movie Interstellar or Gravity, which basically have a very simple story). What makes it so interesting is that Passengers was able to capture those very essence of what it likes to be human being, no matter how vast superior technology & achievement we got in this universe. Were still human with feelings & emotion, sense of humor / anger, sense of hope / lost. Its great movie with taste of humor, romance, action, science & more importantly good ending.The reason why only 9 out of 10 is because some scene dont seems logical to me not because its not scientifically accurate, but simply because they didnt include an additional scene that can be used to support that scientific accuracy. So the audience need to re-think / re-imagine the theory behind it."
9,"Do yourself a favor and see this film. It's way better than what the nay-saying critic and user reviews say. In fact, I thought it was better than 'Manchester By The Sea' which was rated highly, yet was horribly depressing and could have easily been cut by 20 minutes. 'Passengers' is an uplifting tale with a good story, great cinematography and FX, and engaging performances by some of our best artists."
8,"I don't understand most of the problems that people have with this movie. It delivered exactly what the trailer promised. I definitely enjoyed it and wouldn't mind watching it again in a couple of months. It definitely gets you thinking about some ethical questions involving cryo-sleep."
2,"A cliche-filled snooze fest is the easiest way to describe Passengers. The film is genuinely uninteresting, the chemistry and love drama between Pratt and Lawrence is passable but not special, and it is filled to the brim with flaws. In a year full of disappointments, this black list awarded film failed to live up to even the standards of a mediocre movie and adds to the long list of Sony-built failures."
6,"I will admit that this film was undeniable eye candy many times. It had breathtaking visuals and neat effects that at least kept it pretty to watch for the most part. In addition, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence make the most of their star power together, but their roles not so much. In addition, there really wasn't much of a plot or story in this film to be honest. Unsurprisingly (and disappointingly), the film's main focus is on the romance between Pratt and Lawrence and it takes a while for things to really get going until the second half. Overall, while it may be visually appealing and Pratt and Lawrence have decent chemistry together at times, there really isn't much else going for it to really make it worthwhile, especially since there's no deep or compelling story to be found anywhere in the film, let alone much of a story at all I'm afraid."

0,"The worst movie I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. Completely devoid of all meaning. So many things that could have been done with the concept of cryogenics, space and life on a new planet, and this piece of garbage decided to make this a chick flick with a happily ever after ending of them falling in life and building new life on the ship (1.5 minutes of the movie). Laurence Fishburne got a piecemeal role, and despite all actors playing to the best of their ability, the entire movie, save the start and one other scene, was completely pointless, predictable and typical. The ultimate failure of this movie is the plot, and no special effects or good acting could have saved this. This was a complete and utter disappointment, the extent of which is astounding considering the fine actors, an enormous team, and the privilege of modern technology available. Do not see this movie unless you wish to waste your time and money. Because that is exactly what this movie is - a waste of your time, money, and the precious hours of life which you will spend watching this absolute piece of crap. Could not even give this 1 star."
2,"This goes to the people that like a certain actor and want to follow their movies, well... This movie pretty much proved that not every good actor plays a good role. Left me bored to death, the little disastrous moments were cheesy and cliche, and the way it tried to carry on just didn't quite left me satisfied. Go ahead and dislike if you want, but this movie is garbage thrown to your face."
5,"I have given up on Jennifer Lawrence. She has one character she recycles over and over again. I now know that if she is in it, it won't be very good. She has become that cliche of the elite hollywood type that would rather talk politics than do anything good. After the potential of Winters Bone, she has squandered it all away. Can you say Margo Kidder? Can't really say whether this movie is any good, I don't see Jennifer Lawrence movies any longer; don't even watch them on TV."
4,"Boring! Think your walking into a sci-fi action adventure. Turns out your watching some boring space love story that seems to last for 90 years!Pat and Lawrence do have chemistry so i can see why they were cast, but they definitely don't have sexual chemistry! Lawernce puts on a solid performance for what she was given to work with. Movie only shows how much Pratt can't act and his goofeyness seeps into his performance. All in all a waste of 2hrs of your life."
3,"A Sci-Fi film that forgot the Sci-Fi.  This film is very, very slow, and doesn't ever get to a climax that equates to the amount of build up the film forces the audience to endure.  It felt a lot like the German/Austrian Sci-Fi 'Cargo', which was 100 times better.  There are times in the film, were it could have veered off the cliche course of every other typical film, and made something interesting and memorable.  But, alas, it fails to take a chance and employs the same boring plot that has been done too many times before.The story in a nutshell - Man wakes up, is lonely, wakes up girl, girl gets angry, ship has a failure, somehow the dude fixes the ship, dies trying, girl brings dude back to life just in time to to make for a boring cliche plot and all is forgiven, happily ever after."
6,"A moderately entertaining romantic saga set in space that raises some intriguing moral dilemmas but never really delves into the depths of the characters' dire circumstances as deeply as it could have. Fine special effects and capable performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen help to elevate the material somewhat, though its sometimes-plodding pacing, occasionally implausible narrative events and desperate need for a stronger male lead who gets by on more than just his looks weigh things down. A good choice for eventual viewing on cable or DVD, but don't rush out for this one given some of the other excellent releases available at the moment."
4,"Thousands of passengers are on a 120 year journey to colonise a new planet but Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence wake up from their transportation pods 90 years too early and cue the dramatic music cause honestly the soundtrack is about the best thing in this movie. Hidden within this boring mess was an interesting story that unfortunately never gripped me or made me feel anything for the characters. Chris and Jen have very little chemistry together and their whole relationship seemed forced and fake.All this movie achieved was it constantly reminded me of other space related movies that I actually enjoyed. So well done Passengers. If youre looking for a film to put you right to sleep well is this the movie for you, sweet dreams."
7,"Visually stunning (infinity pool into space anyone?), interesting premise, some similarities to Titanic (hole in the ship, Pratt almost freezes in space). Basically, a space ship is on a 120-year journey to a new home planet and everyone on board is in hibernation. Due to a malfunction, Chris Pratt wakes up 90 years too early. He lasts just over a year of loneliness and going crazy before finally deciding to wake up Jennifer Lawrence. The catch? He doesn't tell Lawrence that he woke her up too early. He lets her believe it was an accident (An android barkeep lets the secret out). Needless to say she gets pissed when she finds out."
1,"IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ill give it a one because im nice"
2,"Finally a space movie that brings out everything that we hated in twilight/50 shades and other- based off romance novel -movies. I love Chris Pratt and J-Law, but come on. This movie is written for teenage girls and old women who are fascinated by obsessive and creepy, male love interests. The only thing that could have made this movie any worse would have been a nice, distasteful hibernating boob grope. On a positive note, aside from the occasionally bad blue screen shots, this movie is generally visually okay."

Overall, Passengers isn't a great sci-fi romance movie, because of its stupid but creepy story. Lawrence and Pratt have done a great job, their chemistry is so complicated. The twist is so stupid. But, yet it's still a great visually stunning.

4,"Portato avanti dalla coppia Chris Pratt e Jennifer Lawrence, questo film di fantascienza viaggia attraverso dramma, commedia, romanticismo e azione raccontandoci una storia ambientata nello spazio pi profondo dove ci sono solo tre personaggi. Diretto da Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game), il film si presenta elegante ed originale, ma alla fine cade nella trappola da lui stesso creata: quella di voler essere tante cose senza mai identificarsi in una.La sonda Avalon viaggia a 120 anni dalla Terra verso un pianeta molto distante, dove i suoi 5.000 passeggeri addormentati si sveglieranno per iniziare una nuova vita. Ma dopo solo 30 anni di viaggio, un baccello si aprir per errore. E James (Pratt) si rende conto che lui  uscito dal periodo di ibernazione 90 anni prima del previsto. La sua unica compagnia  un barman robotico (Sheen), ed in un momento di debolezza si sveglier un altro passeggero, Aurora (Lawrence). Mentre cominciano a stabilirsi per trascorrere la loro lunga e solitaria vita insieme, la nave inizia a comportarsi in modo anomalo, svegliando un altro membro dellequipaggio (Laurence Fishburne) che collabora con James ed Aurora per cercare di capire cosa sta accadendo. I tre dovranno sbrigarsi se vorranno salvare la vita degli altri passeggeri.In sostanza, il film  come un mash-up di Titanic e Gravity. LAvalon  una super astronave, e Tyldum scova tutti gli scenari che generano un forte impatto visivo: dal vasto centro commerciale alla splendida piscina per finire con le spettacolari passeggiate spaziali. C un tema interessante sulla disparit tra i passeggeri poveri come il meccanico James e quelli ricchi come Aurora che non viene affrontato a dovere. Pi di un accenno lo meriterebbe anche la questione del conglomerato aziendale che sta facendo una fortuna da questo ambizioso progetto. Ma questi temi profondi rimangono ben al di sotto della superficie, perch lattenzione si focalizza esattamente sul viaggio di James ed Aurora. Questa scelta pu lasciare la sensazione di un film piuttosto sottile e superficiale.Passengers vorrebbe essere un sacco di cose: un po Titanic e un po Odissea nello spazio, ma non riesce ad essere una versione convincente di nessuna di queste storie. Pratt fa un ottimo lavoro in proprio, anche se tutto ci che gli viene chiesto  fare una faccia triste con quella sua barba comica, il che non  credibile. Una volta che incontra Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence),  difficile da digerire la mancanza di chimica tra i due. Questo  probabilmente il punto pi basso della Lawrence. Il salvatore della recitazione  il divertente barista Michael Sheen.Conclusioni:Passengers vorrebbe vendersi anche come un thriller psicologico alla Kubrick. I cenni alla Kubrick ci sono ed appaiono interessanti, ma il film non si avvicina nemmeno di striscio ai livelli della narrativa e complessit visiva di Kubrick. Ancora meno simpatiche sono le decisioni piuttosto artificiose della sceneggiatura, che non va di pari passo con i personaggi divertenti e limmaginario stupendo del film. In altre parole, nonostante le buone idee iniziali e lo scenario di contorno, questo Passengers risulta solo una piccola ma piacevole evasione di due ore dai problemi della terra.by Ale Wonder from Wonder Channel (www.wonderchannel.it)"
7,"I liked the movie. Can`t really say I disliked anything in it, though I also can`t say I`ll remember anything in particular. I must say I expected much better special effects but wasn`t dissapointed by the whole package. A cool movie to see in cinema with your gf or friends. I`m not sure that everybody will like the ending though.Sure, the premise is interesting. The spaceship is the 2nd star of the film. Pretty nice interiors, pretty original design, cool facilities. So a guy wakes up early and doesn`t know why and he must find out why.Acting is strong. The chemistry is definitely there. All four actors play I`d say the maximum out of their given characters, enough to be both likable and believable. Dialogues are ok, never boring, always to the point and sometimes funny.The plot is VERY simple although I can`t think up a reason why I`d want it to be complicated at all. It is a mini love story in space with some elements of action. I guess I liked it to an extent I didn`t feel my money wasted. But yeah, it is not a blockbuster, just a fine flick to see if you feel going to the movies."

4,"'It is as if The Notebook and Interstellar had sex and had a baby.' - My cousinI am going to write a review, but this quote really sums up everything about this film. From the creepy and morally unethical meeting (waking up Aurora vs threatening to kill yourself in The Notebook) to the premise, time spent away from family traveling, and the gratuitous shots of the ship in space (Interstellar), Passengers is a sick concoction of the two. As neither of those films are great (Interstellar being good and The Notebook above average), it should be obvious that Passengers would wind up being disappointingly below average. Though its leads try their best, the inherently creepy nature of their romance, cliches, awful second half, and director Morten Tyldum's obsession with the Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt's asses and sex appeal derail Passengers.The premise has been much discussed at this point, but it is certainly an engaging one. After a collision with a meteor, a spaceship traveling for 120 years to a new planet with 5,000 people aboard begins to malfunction, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) wakes up 90 years too early. Left on his own, he finds ways to pass the time, such as speaking to the android bartender (Michael Sheen). During this portion of the film, it is certainly slow, but is entirely compelling. The audience feels Jim's isolation, desperation, and loneliness. He is just a normal guy who wanted a fresh start, but is instead dealt the worst hand possible and is left all alone on this ship. However, Passengers quickly nosedives. Though Jim knows it is morally wrong to wake up Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), a woman he noticed and began to stalk and obsess over, he opts to wake her up anyways. Passengers then goes on to half-heartedly scold him, try and have us root for him, and seemingly draw a parallel between that action and a later one by Aurora. Spoiler, she wakes up him later on in the film. It is clear the film is about the lengths we go to in order to not be lonely, but that the end justifies the means. Fortunately, it seems that Tyldum was onto this one and knew audiences would reject this moral. Though powerless to change the story, he opted to just have Pratt rip off his shirt and Lawrence get naked (even though she does not have to strip to get into that suit, just hike up your skirt you idiot). If the plot is creepy, Tyldum gives the film a few extra sprinkles of sexy and shots of asses in order to try and distract less discerning audiences. For those still unable to forget the 'moral dilemma' faced by Jim and his actions, the proceeding hour and a half or so will just get progressively creepier and, as one critic pointed out, begin to resemble Stockholm Syndrome.However, it would be misleading to claim that the creepy nature of the romance is Passengers' only flaw. It is also incredibly cliche. With the romance being incredibly trite, the aforementioned 'sexiness' is used to try and spice up the film. Instead, it only further distracts from the plot and adds nothing to the film. The romance in this film feels as though the studio loved the setting and the original premise of the film, but opted to make it more commercially viable. Thus, they cast two attractive leads and decided the innovation of the film would be to have them have sex in space. While I admit seeing so much sex in space was a first for me, the romance itself is hardly new. Most romance films have a creepy beginning, secrets, and the cringeworthy 'you die, I die' line. The film's cliches know no bounds as well with the two leads physically incapable of dying. Unfortunately, convenient plot devices such as Chief Gus Mancuso (Laurence Fishburne), are not as immortal. Woken up two years after Jim due to the ship malfunctioning, Gus Mancuso may be the funnest character, but is the most cliche. The definition of a convenient occurrence, Mancuso exists only to explain the situation to the main characters, wag his finger judgmentally at Pratt, and then die. In his short time alive, Mancuso is able to give the characters access to the entire ship, which enables them to fix the ship. This invariably leads up to the over-the-top ending in which Jim Preston survives a situation nobody could reasonably expect to survive. Here, Passengers plays into the stereotypical 'Hollywood ending' and even has the gaul to skip 88 years into the future and ignore the fact the characters' corpses are still on the ship. After having a thoroughly compelling premise and great opening with Jim wandering the ship, Passengers' second half is nothing but a creepy and cliched romance, cliched scenes of peril, and a simplistic and rosy ending ill-fitting of a film of this ilk. That said, Passengers is not all bad. Though the writing is lackluster and plain, the special effects and visuals are anything but. With a gorgeous ship that Tyldum loves taking advantage of, the camera slides around this ship with ease and captures every gorgeous inch."
6,"This is not a bad movie, but it does have some weird stuff in it, especially from the movie non-logic side:SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Although it does a lot to cover the plot holes, there's a gaping plothole at the end:If they were capable of accessing the crew, then why:1. Didn't they wake up the crew when Gus woke up so they could all go back to the pods?2. Didn't they wake up the crew when Jim was rescued so they could all go back to the pods?I get that this is about the romance etc. but they shouldve added a good explanation of why they didn't save themselves via waking up the crew...The Melancholic Alcholic"
10,"The Passenger is absolutely the best movie I've seen so far for these few years. I just can't understand why it has such a low rating. Before watching this movie, I always had a thought that a movie with only few casts would be boring, and now, I realise I was wrong. There was never a second I feel any boring, instead, i enjoyed the full movie, immersed in the romantic yet thrilling story."
6,"I wanted to see this over Christmas, but family I was visiting vetoed it because of the less than stellar reviews.  The critic herd went the other way from their all too often mass over-praise and general easy going across the board and seems to have under-rated here.  A shame since it looked to be a 'Gravity' like (9 rating) big popcorn entertainment, so desperately missing in general at the box office this holiday season.  This actually is very much a 'Gravity' type adventure but much more sci-if in scale and future imaginings.  Yet it has about as unique a story concept as it gets with these things in today's Hollywood.  It is pretty smart science fiction that wisely sets up a plot development that gives the romance some real pathos.  I buy the love story in this more than that in 'Allied'.  Where it goes wrong is all but a given these days:  it turns too formula in the end.  Well, it sure could have been worse, way worse.I'm a fan of Thomas Newman's music, which most of the time adds an emotional weight to the proceedings whatever they are in all the so many films he's scored.  This time is no exception.  The photography is subtly rich and conventionally shot making it infinitely more watchable than such handheld junk as 'Jason Bourne' or 'Patriots Day'.  The leads are fine.  They are stars and pull you along as stars must do.  The pace is slow, but that is not always a bad thing as '2001' demonstrates to the point of masterpiece genius ultimate classic.  This is not a great movie that requires multiple viewings for its total effect though.  Think of it as '2001 Very Lite' or '3016:  A Millennial Romantic Odyssey'."

The first two thirds of Passenger's is powerful, unfortunately the final third is average. Many opportunities are wasted to develop two very strong characters, and some things are added unnecessarily.
"
4,"So I've discovered something new - that my jaw hurts if I spend much of a film with my teeth clenched, who'd have known! There is much to admire here, the cinematography is wonderful, the concept design is excellent and the performances are polished and engaging. The pacing is not as fast as it should be, though that's probably to try to build tension. There are a number of charming moments; Lawrence and Pratt are excellently matched, but then we come to the storyline, and it is here where there is much to despise. There are a number of pivotal moments which, had they gone another way, arguably any other way, this could have been redeemed. It didn't so it isn't, and that is maddening and disappointing in equal measure. To avoid spoilers I'll simply leave it with this: No. 4.03/10"
7,"'Passengers' Is Diminished By Misguided Attempts of Jon SpaihtsWorthy of the third place among the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood (Black List); nine years ago (2007), 'Passengers' sign was just a basic preliminary version predisposing to find a studio to financing its making with $35 million initial cost and possibly starring multi-nominated Keanu Reeves and Emily Blunt. Eventually, Sony Pictures got IP rights and fortunately signed Morten Tyldum up in the direction to materialize it with $110 million extraordinary production budget with fabulous signing of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as leaders of the ambitious project. Today, they present us an already assembled film, aesthetically superb, with unimaginable argumentative potentials and a harmonious chemistry between its main leads, however, its biggest point break is specifically in the screenplay, which diverges tirelessly from that original version established it among the best unrealized projects.In the adjacent future, mankind is able to emigrate from over-populated and ruined Earth for leaving and seek for habitable spaces abroad. The starship Avalon is transporting 5,000 passengers and over 200 crew members in a cryogenic sleep for a journey that takes 120 years in order to arrive in Homestead II, the new planet Earth. Although everything seems to indicate that the cyclopean experiment will be satisfactory, the spaceship collides hardly against a meteorite, which stirs up the breakdown of one sleep chamber, Jim Paterson's, our protagonist. Each person in the ship has a unique and substantial occupation around the population of the new colony: doctors, microbiologists, nurses, machinists, law specialists, etc. Jim is a young mechanical engineer, who quickly becomes aware that he has awakened 90 years early the official advent, contemplating ethical and moral dilemmas as intrinsic as outer space where the story runs. After one year of being in a techno-transitory paradise, he finally concludes to awaken to one traveler and keeping in mind that it would practically be to immolate her, male protagonist's elections are deeply objectionable. she's named Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), a writer from New York who aims to write a book about her personal experience in the new world and return to the planet Earth with the most amazing story. Nevertheless, failure accumulation of the huge ship and different narrative confidences push them to the edge of space, literally.The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is incredibly absorbent, it's imposing accompanied by dazzling production design, where prevails snowy and dreary tones which divinely adapt to prelude in order to connect with main character's isolation.The film's cardinal mission is spectators must put oneself in Jim's shoes, it suggests them convoluted dilemmas of the character and deleterious corollaries drive by the silence demon. Chris Patt's charisma in the first few minutes as survivor into a technological spaceship is enough to keep it afloat, he wanders naked with asuperfluouslylong beard, formulating himself moral matters such as suicide, a death foretold and unbearable solitude. Although many people didn't realize, The decision of Jim must be worthy of debate and more worthy must be its subsequent actions. In the middle of the film, when love starts to flow between lovers, Stockholm syndrome is patent and the protagonist can be stealthily described as a harasser. However, this scene is covered with Tyldum's direction, who focused on other banalities.With the arrival of Aurora, the fascinating concepts raised in the first hour of the sci-fi movie take their place at the end of the list, since it opts for conceiving a bland affair, a romance as sporadic as tedious. Go from there, the movie breaks down and loses the land he was harvested beside 'Gravity', 'Interstellar' or the more recent 'Arrival'. Although it works excellently as a romantic film, it is the third act which affects decisively its	prestige. Its unsatisfactory ending wasn't the most pertinent for concluding this futuristic story.Frustrating, a missed opportunity. For those who attend to a movie theater without having depths and inconsistencies in mind, 'Passengers' is the favorite candy for mass audiences. For us who inherently love films and we're as severe as objectives, 'Passengers' is an irregular movie, but essentially spoiled. This one is a true sign that the nature of the seventh art is to narrate a story, a tightly structured story, not mere visual beauty. With a first part which puts in manifest our deepest human questions; the exciting and controversial issues are imperceptibly mitigated into a surplus drama-romance and a typical Hollywood final sequence, which could be circumstantially sublime hugging the original one. It makes us think that it's another corporate product, but inside us, we know that Sony dropped a film which be aiming for the top between its hands."
7,"In brief, Passengers is an interesting central premise wrapped in slick science-fiction production and a moral quandary overshadowing the two primary characters. This is not a gritty take on the potential for human colonization because that isn't the focus, just the catalyst for two people facing death on board a luxury transport vessel, before reaching their intended destination. If you like realism in your films then you need not apply; if you're hoping for a deep dive into the morality of condemning another to death out of desperate loneliness, then this is not for you either. The film balances it's leads against the escalating threat, and never really commits to either.Chris Pratt is beginning to show as a relatively one note actor, leaving Jennifer Lawrence, as usual, to do most of the heavy lifting--she makes a noticeable impact on the film once she shows up. Both work well enough together as Chris settles into familiar likeability territory and Jennifer shows why she earned her $20 million, eventually wrapping up in a predictable but satisfying ending that's sure to please most.Much has been made of Chris waking Jennifer for his own needs, and it is reactionary and unfounded. Enough screen time is devoted to showing the agonising decision prior, during and after the fallout for this not to be pounced upon in today's delicate climate--their are more important battles to be fought than in this above average and entertaining film."
10,"An awesome movie for a very specific audience.  Not for teenagers looking for a Star Wars type movie.  Take 50% Titannic, 38% Cast Away, and 7% Hunger Games.  Mix it all together and throw it into space and you've got Passengers.  If you liked those movies you will like this.  Excellent acting, superb sets and scenery, and a decent adventure/romance movie. Good script that moved the film along at a fast pace. The CGI was so seamlessly integrated into the film that I was on my way home before I even realized It had been there (unlike Star Wars and most of the other action/adventure films). Unfortunately, my theater did not have it in 3D as it must have been totally breathtaking in that.And, in spite of many of the critics' complaints, the reactions and actions of both Jim & Aurora are completely normal and realistic under the circumstances.I would love to go back and see it again."

In what seems to be a trend in movies these days, the trailer for Passengers is a little misleading. Without spoiling things, the premise of this movie is a LOT darker than we are led to believe."

Not sure why the critics are ripping it so unmercifully, because its way better than the majority of the mid-summer crap than Hollywood churned out (again) this year.   Part of the enjoyment has to do with the sound effects, and the deep and rhythmically powerful report of Afflecks weapon of choice, which I found to be totally awesome.

The movie is a little bit John Wick, given the frequency of kill shots to the head, but mostly I found the story line to be reminiscent of a Batman or Marvel Comic book movie plot, without the super-hero costumes or super-hero powers, (though towards the end Afflecks character does absorb enough explosions and punches to strain the credulity of even novice moviegoers).  The knock on Ben Affleck is that his acting has a bit of an emotionally restricted range to begin with, and thus playing a character with a high-functioning form of Autism is right up his alley, but it works for him in this movie, so who cares.  Anna Kendrick shines, and makes the most out of a somewhat limited role.  Hopefully, we will start to see more movies with her in a lead role."
8,"The Accountant has the makings of a franchise. You have a protagonist with a personality disorder, a classic yin and yang between math and violence, a tension between apparently dark means and potentially noble ends, and a lead actor who fits the role extremely well. Think of a modern version of Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name in the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone. True, the story has too much clutter in terms of subplots, but by the time those flaws became apparent, I was hooked on the main character and the puzzle. The primary villain was also quite interesting and well played. Audiences respond to a movies entertainment value, while critics, sometimes in a misguided pursuit of professional craft, can miss this fundamental point, and appear to have done so in this case. I suspect the audience ratings will continue to far outpace those of the critics and, in this case, go with the wisdom of the crowd."
7,"An action film that starts slow, but builds into a pretty fun time.  The story is told with many flashbacks and while I figured out most of the surprising reveals they all make sense and don't hurt the film.  Overall I was entertained throughout and Affleck outside the bat suit shows he has the action style down pat.  B+"
7,"After seeing this for myself, I must say that I'm a little surprised at how cold most critics have been towards this film. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit due to its intelligence and compelling stunts and action from Ben Affleck throughout, who gives a solid lead performance. Granted there are a few cliche moments and plot points, but they certainly didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the film. Overall, it's not the best action film this year, but it does add up to a fun and entertaining enough and worthwhile watch."
8,"Wolf's family : husband and wife with their two kids visit a school for autistic with the hope that they will find a solution for Christian.

In present dayChristian Wolf (Ben Affleck) is a already the owner of C.P.A office 'ZZZ Accountant', one day he helps old couples with tax problems, and he settled it for them, these old couples so happy then offered him their ranch so he can do his hobby : shootinganytime he want to. Then, comes the offer from LivingRobotics C.E.O and owner Lamar Black (John Lightgow) to get a very close look to all booking, and on the process he get acquainted with this junior accounting staff, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendricks)

Meanwhile, a soon will be retired Treasury Department agent Raymond King (J.K Simmons) assigns an analyst Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to investigate a mysterious person that always caught by a surveillance camera in several countries along with some international criminals. Medina accept this job reluctantly under King's threat,that he will revealed her dark covered past that will put her in jail for good.

As the investigations goes, Wolf share his finding on the company 15 years booking with Dana, that something is wrong with the bookings.That now and then there's a leak, and to where did those leakage go? How?And why? But this leakage finding only just bring in Brax a vicious assassin into action.Then, Lamar stop Chris to stop the booking investigation.Chris cannot accept that. He begins to anxious because he must finish his job. Whatever he started must finished perfectly. Withouthis knowledge, a reservation is made on him. Brax and his team will execute them both. But only to find out that The Accountant not just an accountant that really good calculating with numbers of books, but also expert on calculating a person's lifetime. When Chris found out that a contract also made on Dana, he went mad and star a rampage killings.

This Christian Wolf character is really unique, who once just an autism boy,but then grew up with a career as an accountant, not in a big reputation company but work with high profile most wanted international dangerous criminals. And the screenplay is so clever keep a question (I don't know if other audiences sense this) how the hell a man with end up in a dark career like this, some audiences perhaps begin to question this when viewed Christian Wolf once service in US Army more then 10 years before. Ben Affleck acting  not an Oscar level  but show a maturity from time to time, I admit that for quiet a while it's look like I see a bit shadow of Bruce Wayne from his eye look. He looks so convincing to perform when this character snap for the first time related to his job as an accountant. The emotions he hold between him and Dana, the sudden bumbling when he wave bye to the couple old husband and wives after he save them from being hostage by 2 hit men that sent to kill him (he killed the 2 hit men with cold blood). At this parts looks like I've shown Chris transform from a thorough autism shy bashful accountant into another persona :skillful killer with no remorse.

Anna Kendrick also a good choice to perform Dana Cummings, a junior accountant staff with warm personality, simple and sincere. She is the first person after so many years that give him a deep impression and make him care much, deep enough to defend her with all his got. He will stop at nothing to keep her alive. I enjoy the chemistry build bit by bit between this 2 characters.

Other thing that I like so much about this movie is that like I watch several stand alone movies in 1 packet kind like several mini spin off stories inside main story. The family, 2 Treasury Department agents, Christian Wolf and his interaction with Dana, the ruthless assassin Brax. But all goes smooth into one direction, and I said to my self 'Woww..what is going down? And then finally 'What the hell?'

I also gave credit to all support cast, J.K Simmons plays character Kings solidly as an uncompromising superior that will do anything to gain his will. Chyntia Addai Robinson also give her good play as a Treasury agent under pressure. And John Berthal already gave very nasty impression since the beginning until his character

Then I browse about the director, then I struck on movie 'Warrior' (Joe Edgerton and Tom hardy), I already saw that movie, a very emotion touch sport drama. Gavin O Connor gave a very good piece of work that he combined drama, violence and inter- characters conflict as a wholesale spectacle to us. And he did it again.

And another thing, since I'm from Indonesia, I really surprise this movie use #PencakSilat and #BahasaIndonesia. When the father train his sons pencaksilat under professional trainer, the trainer suggested to had enough training for that day, but the father insist with a reason that he must know his sons limit and it's the trainer job to find out. And the young Chris said 'Tak apa apa, lanjutkan saja' (It's alright, keep continues). Then it's just like a moment for young Chris to find himself that day, to overcome his autism to face life.

My conclusion is this, with all those premises, stand alone stories that the script give, all it takes just one emphatic reason to bring out the action. Kinda clich but, you don't need any difficult reason for a personality with autism background to defend what he care for. Finally, The Accountant is a calm with effective deadly moves. It's really #GoodWillHuntingMeetJackReacher. Rate : 8/10"
7,"Good movie. Basically, you have this smart kid who has a father in the military who teaches him how to fight. This kid eventually becomes a very successful accountant in the underworld and...overworld? Is that the word for it? Overworld? Anyways, things get messy when he his hired to find a leak for a huge corporation. There are some cool action scenes and accounting scenes. That is the gist.

I wish there were more accounting scenes though. I hope the DVD has deleted scenes of The Accountant helping more people like the farm couple. I also hope there is an extra feature on the DVD showing things that are near and dear to The Accountant. He has an original Jackson Pollock that has the 'Eddie Van Halen' color pattern and an Action Comics #1 so you know he has other good stuff. Why doesn't he have Detective Comics #27! The Accountant is Batman for goodness' sake! Maybe he does have one but we didn't see his whole collection. Do you see what I'm saying?"

Stylish, offbeat, and tense, The Accountant seizes the viewers' attention and grasps it for the rest of its run time with its well crafted action sequences, complex performances, and fantastic direction.

9,"My high expectations for 'The Accountant' was satisfied 100%. This movie was so intelligently done and was absolutely investing from beginning to end. From the very opening moment, I was gripped into the story and did not break out of the hold until credits rolled. The mystery, the action, the intelligence of this movie is done so well, I can not be more fulfilled in what I could want in a film... Everyone in 'The Accountant' had a rightful fit and knocked home-runs out of the park when they were on screen. Easily, Affleck had a performance of a lifetime, for me. His secretive yet extremely intelligent and underlying charismatic character of Christian Wolff is done to perfection. Jon Bernthal, once again, and I will not stop posting this until I see a performance I am not impressed with. does phenomenally well with the character he portrays of Brax. His confident intensity is prevalent in nearly every character he plays and it is done so well again in Brax. Now in attempt to not lengthen this section even more, I pay great respects to J.K. Simmons, Anna Kendrick, Jeffrey Tambor, Cynthia Addai-Robinson and everyone else because every name did so well to contribute to this story. No one felt unnecessary... My only negative points come from minor spoilers of the film, so if you would be interested to discuss, feel free to contact me but otherwise, the negative points do not persuade me enough to feel differently of the film as a whole. It was too strong of a movie creative wise and performance wise for minor issues to take too much of a position in my stance.

Highly recommended and one of my favorites of the year."

Great movie with beautifully written characters and a great plot to back everything up. The actors do a great job and the directing is top notch as well. I couldn't recommend it more if you're craving for an intense yet meaningful action drama.

7,"Ben Affleck plays a math savant on the Autism spectrum who spends his days as a quiet CPA, but freelances for major criminal organizations and even mortally dispatches some of them. The narrative also involves flashbacks to his father's influence, a sympathetic clerk who arouses his affection (Anna Kendrick) and a government agent who's out to stop him (J.K. Simmons). The premise seems a bit preposterous and it's not really clear how the plot's complex machinations happen. Affleck stays pretty stone faced thru it all, registering as a mysteriously-connected mastermind and a sure-shot action hero. There's enuff complexity in the story to keep it interesting and a few moments of action to add some fun. If you can get past the ludicrousness of the story, you may enjoy watching it all unfold."
9,"This is an amazing movie, very entertaining and kept me interested through the whole movie. It's very underrated by protentious critics. It is not an oscar movie, it's a great time. Best time I've had in months to be honest. Anyone who find this plot all over the place, as the critic seems to be has a very small attention span."
9,"I call this film the perfect Hitman movie, from that you can surmise some of the plot and type of action the viewer will see. Were it differs, is in the great story telling with scenes similar to that of the first part of die hard that give the view a great insite that explains the deep intricacy's of Ben Affleck's character the accountant who is a Autistic Maths genius, a expect soldier and explains his motives well. The film isn't all action however and has sections of levity from the mannerisms of Affleck's characters autism, infact the cinema audience laughed more at this than the last ten comedys that ive seen, so it broke the action and narrative seens up well."
7,"A compelling, subtle performance from Ben Affleck is what'll ultimately keep the audience in their seats as they watch 'The Accountant,' a slightly implausible, plodding thriller with a call-it-from-a-mile-away twist and some general narrative issues plaguing it all throughout. Gavin O'Connor's frenetic action direction also helps sweeten the deal offered by this mostly enjoyable romp through corporate America's darkest, most violent depths."
7,"
While not quite as good as I was hoping, The Accountant is a fascinating and entertaining character study with some great acting and solid action. It definitely doesn't deserve the negative reviews it's been getting.
"
7,"The Accountant is one of the more interesting character study films I've seen in a good while, at least until it isn't. Ben Affleck's gives it his all in a subdued and nuanced performance which lead to one of his best performances to date. The film has too many subplots, it has too many characters and it does go on too long. However, the good out ways the negatives here and I hope this can become a new franchise in the future."

The Accountant is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A thrilling and smart film that keeps you on the edge of your seats. Filled with captivating performances. As well as white dialogue and intense action sequences
"
8,"Ben Affleck is becoming one of Hollywood's hottest sells. The movies he directs are strong and his recent performances are turning heads, he was the best thing about Batman V Superman after months of scepticism, and with The Accountant he is proving to be able to add depth to a titular action hero. Here he plays the Accountant, an autistic man having grown up learning very violent ways to defend himself from his militaristic father. Whilst un-cooking the books for deadly clientele he uses these skills to good measure until some rather lethal people start to hunt him down. The Accountant starts slow, showing a good 50 minutes of maths and numbers before any plot really kicks in but it is when it does that it really takes hold. This accountant is violent, nasty and emotionless and he makes for a rather interesting protagonist. It isn't the plot that keeps this going it is the backstory of the character. Whilst learning of his past the film hits its peak and when it returns to the main narrative it does derail slightly. This does make it rather messy as there is a lot going on with many expositional accountancy speeches that are confusing as anything, but don't see this for the numbers see it for the action set pieces and Affleck's performance. Other performers aren't given the room like Affleck but Jon Bernthal does also bring weight to his character. Kendrick gets sidelined as the story unfolds and Simmons has played characters like this in his sleep, that's not to say he isn't good here mind. Others are given smaller roles but really it is Affleck's accountant that you are here to watch. Forget about the films many flaws, contrivances and tangled narrative and go switch off for two hours and enjoy a good solid action thriller. It is a lot more fun then it is given credit for."
10,"Excellent movie. It's funny what the bad reviews say. Everything was explained, there were no plot holes (seen several reviews saying that they were too dumb to follow the story). Ben did a very good job in his portrayal of an autistic man. The story plot has a lot of depth, good character development, and the twists are somewhat surprising without being forced. I would have given it an 8.5/10, but seeing how the typical response of flat out stupid people people have once again hurt the true score I'll give it a ten in hopes of balancing it out to its true score."
7,"Ben Affleck was fantastic. The action was pretty excellent. There were some genuinely funny parts. there was an (in my opinion) un-needed side story that felt like it pulled away from what we really wanted to see. The twists were predictable. It's nothing I would go raving about but it's a good entertaining couple of hours."

Great movie. Not your usual action movie. Original and well written. Maybe your not your usual hero. It is hard to relate to a character with very little emotional range.

Went to see this last night and must say that both my hubby and I really enjoyed it.  A bit of a modern Robin Hood.  Will gladly go see it again with friends who didn't get to the premier last night.

8,"The  Accountant is a sometimes confusing but highly entertaining movie. It gives another insight into the hidden mind of the autistic person, and some understanding. I had trouble hearing some of the dialogue, and  piecing the plot together but found it exciting and great entertainment. I recommend it. I would say that movie critics are a jaded lot, and should try making one."
7,"If you like a good thriller, this is the sort of film that will entertain and engage you, but do little else. Whilst The Accountant features some great performances and some moderately interesting thrills, its also a bit of a let-down when it comes to the overall mystery, which gets more and more convoluted and confused as the film progresses, making it feel a lot more like a slow trudge to the finish than a proper thriller should be.However, this isnt necessarily a bad film, and the main reason for that is the performances. Above all, Ben Affleck is amazing in the lead role. Playing a genius man with autism, hes both likable and exciting, but also gives off a brooding and intimidating intensity that makes his character far more interesting, providing the majority of the films overall mystery.Whats more is that he suits the wide range of genres in this film very well. His dramatic intensity is second to none, but as he proved with his performance in Batman v Superman, hes actually a very good action star, and does a great job when the film moves away from its slower, more dialogue-based intrigue.Alongside Affleck, theres a heap of A-listers in the supporting roles. Whilst not all of them are so impressive (the likes of Anna Kendrick and Cynthia Addai-Robinson arent the most engaging to watch), J.K. Simmons is excellent in providing emotional intrigue in a very calm and quiet role, whilst Jon Bernthal and John Lithgow also impress in smaller roles.For the most part, the performances are the best thing about The Accountant. However, I have to say that I really enjoyed everything about the opening act. Promising a cerebral and patient thriller, director Gavin OConnor does well to set up the various plots that will all eventually come to a head, thanks to a confident and consistently gritty style (in the vein of the TV show Homeland), whilst the screenplay plants a whole host of seeds for future excitement that got me very interested.However, following the captivating first act, the entire film begins to take a dive. OConnor continues his gritty style well, but the mixing of intense, dialogue-based thrills and big-budget shoot-outs doesnt really fit all that well, and whilst Ben Affleck manages to bridge the genres well, the rest of the film feels a little stuck in the wilderness with regards to what sort of film it wants to be.The biggest problem, though, is the way the plot becomes so increasingly convoluted and messy as the film goes on. Whilst the plethora of characters and side plots early on gives the promise of various thrills, The Accountant ultimately becomes incredibly inconsistent in its focus and pacing of those stories.In short, we spend far too long focused on one story or other (often up to twenty minutes without seeing any other characters), and the film unfortunately begins to take on an anthology style, ruining the overall story arcs intensity and mystery. As a result, I was left bewildered as to what was really going on, and as the pacing begins to worsen as the film goes on, it feels like a longer and longer watch, offering little more in terms of intrigue and unpredictability.Overall, whilst I was impressed by many elements of this movie, I was ultimately disappointed. The central performance by Ben Affleck is brilliant, and the entire first act is enthralling, but the way that the story takes such a dive as the film goes on, becoming more and more convoluted, and as a result more and more uninteresting and difficult to follow, was a huge shame to see."
8,"Very entertaining.  Typically we can understand where some critics are coming from, but their response to this one had us and the reviewers near us a bit baffled. We think audiences are going to enjoy this a lot more, and many critics got it wrong this time.  The film is a nice blend of drama, action, and thought.  However, its written differently than the usual fare, which also lends to some unexpected dialog.  I think the discontinuity here is one of what your expectations are going in. One final note: the probabilities a few professional critics mentioned arent as low as they purport.  Talented professionals at the top of any field have a tendency to run into each other eventually.  Go see this film, youll have a good time."
9,"This movie is absolutely amazing. For the life of me I cannot see why the critics gave it so much hate. The action scenes are great, the script is great, and the characters (particularly Ben Affleck's) are all amazing. Plus, Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick had amazing chemistry."
8,"The Accountant is an interesting and eccentric movie that is well worth seeing. But it is unconventional and has some faults, and perhaps thats why a lot of critics I trust had a bad day with it and gave it low marks it does not deserve. Ben Affleck and all the other actors are excellent. The problem, I think, lies in the editing. The childhood section goes on much too long (I was thinking about what to have for dinner), but the rest of the film moved along in a  hectic autistic mode, which helps you make sense of things in a strange way and makes Christian Wolff (Affleck) very sympathetic. If you go with it, The Accountant is a very enjoyable film with its own version of a happy ending. Id like a sequel!"
10,"I am 54 and have seen quite a lot of action movies.  There are years in which I saw over 100 in the theater. Once in a while there is a film that seems to have everything going for it, but it comes across flat.  Other films, usually because of the lead actor, are fun to watch even though they really are not good films.  The Accountant is an excellent film because everything about it is good.  The Equalizer was a straightforward gem, not really imaginative, but perfectly executed.  John Wick was top notch with some new elements, and the new elements pushed it above most of the genre.  The Accountant gives us a perfectly crafted protagonist.  We get to know why he is the way he is.  He is created in this film and the process of learning his back ground is not damaging to the movie.  The back story is not senseless or drawn out.  The action is solid and real.  I find overblown action quite entertaining, but this isn't that sort of film.  There is still plenty of action, and frankly, a lot of the film that is not action is so well shot, acted, and edited, that I was completely engaged as if it was one good chase scene after another.

Why so many bad reviews?  They wanted a different movie.  One professional wanted more action.  Another was left cold by the fact that this film is abnormally complicated for an action movie.  They want Taken or Lethal Weapon.  Frankly I am a bit surprised.  Critics usually watch SO MANY films that they pan decent films because they offer nothing new. They are just like a hundred other films.  Critics often lead us astray by recommending pretty mediocre films that are being recommended because they are telling a story seldom told, or doing it in a new way, not because it is actually an excellent film.  This film should have been right up their alley, but I guess a lot of them were not up to the content, simply wanted to **** or got tricked into thinking the film was going to be something else.  The public seems to have understood what they were going to see and appreciated how it was done.

I ask myself a question about movies; was that movie as good as that movie could be?  Was it miscast?  Did the actor lack the talent for the role, or was the actor misdirected?  Was the filming or editing distracting or boring? Were there logic mistakes noticed during the film, or nagging after the film?  In the end, was that particular film as good as that particular film could be?  If you go see Die Hard and expect to see The Matrix then you screwed yourself.  It isn't the movies fault if you WANTED it to be something else.  It isn't your fault if the movie failed at what it was trying to do.  If the movie wasn't a story that could be good or great, then the producers made a bad choice.  If it could have been great but was miscast or misdirected then shame on them.  The Accountant is the perfect version of itself.  Ben Affleck is perfect.  The filming and editing is perfect.  The cast in general is good.  The little tricks and reveals of the plot/story are logical.  Some people may be lost by the little tricks and reveals, but that is why there are comic books and there are novels.  Not everyone is suited for everything.  To bad for you that you went to the wrong movie.  Both my wife and I missed a plot point.  When we said 'Oh, that was explained by, or really was, X.' to each other, we were even happier with the film.  The strings we thought were left untied, were neatly tied off after all.  This is an action movie, not Citizen Kane.  It is not some new adventure like the original Star Wars.  Don't expect to be mesmerized.  See this film expecting to watch a film worthy of your attention."
10,"I knew this would be a good film, but I didn't expect it be the best Affleck performance/action thriller I've seen in years. This film is absolutely genius from the plot to its brutal intense action scene executions.There are several complex layers in the story with some big clever twists and the emotional depth in the acting was astounding as well. After this, Ben Affleck might be the new go to action star. He slaughters his batman role in this as the autistic brilliant savant killer Christian Wolfe. So many new classic films this year."
10,"I went into this movie knowing nothing but the name of it, and the metacritic score so I had low expectations. I just picked it semi-randomly because I needed to pass the time that day unexpectedly and I didn't want to get into anything too 'good' because I might have to leave. Anyway, long story short, this one hit me in the heart. I'm on the autistic spectrum somewhere (very high functioning, also bipolar) and multiple members of my family are autistic including a non verbal first cousin. I spent a lot of this film recognizing moments, habits, and quirks in an action hero that I almost never expected to see. Yeah, a lot of it was 'on the nose' and some of it was played for laughs... but I think a lot of people forget that many like to laugh at themselves. And also, some may complain it presents autistic people as violent, but that's the same as saying that die hard presents bald men as violent (arguably more true). It's your typical 'no qualms about killing action hero' type, but this time he's also the numbers guy, not the person he's dragging along. I actually cried at a couple points. Right?

Anyway, yes, I'm rating this higher than it probably deserves for being a dumb action flick in many other ways, but the plotholes aren't as bad as I expected and better than most, and I want to offset some of the really undeserved critical panning. I liked it!

There's also another prominent (spoilers!) autistic character and their presentation was great!"
10,"Deliver the Oscar now!

Best Performance by a Toupee I've seen all year. But once again, it'll be all about the politics when it comes to voting time by the Academy.

Why do celebrities have to wear toupees? Is it because they're trying to stay young-looking or appeal to the legion of people out there who hate the baldies?

I think Ben is successful enough that he could make a stand and say, 'Yes, I am bald and a philanderer and a card cheat but I have two Oscars and I am Batman. Listen to me and free us from these bad hairpieces. '

That's what I'd do if I was him."
7,"This, along with Mr. Holmes broke my cycle of bad movies(storks(Tulip was great though),snowden(biased and dull),and Deepwater(Great first half,then downhill)). The sound is great with the boom of the 50.cal. The whole movie, as I thought, is reserved in terms of action compared to Cap America or Independence day. It takes the middle ground. The most reserved action being pretty much anything from A24. Also it's smart with all the money talk. Anna Kendrick is cute and Ben Affleck did a great performance.Although,the long string of revelations,or more, filling in the past, isn't as revealing as it should be. And the ending sequence feels too familiar and happy compared with big name studios. Even though I do see why a writer wants to give troubled characters happiness. Now to see the Girl on The Train."

It doesn't entirely reinvent the wheel, and while I could see one of its twists coming from a mile away, it's still a thoroughly fun thriller with both a fascinating lead character and an interesting story.

10,"I can't believe the mixed reviews. The performances were perfect - especially with Affleck. This film delivered a wonderful mix of action, thrills, drama, great comedic timing, and, surprisingly, a beautiful portrayal of autism. This film did so much that critics mistook DIVERSE tone for 'uneven' tone. They are different and this film is a great time."
9,"Puzzles!! What's really cool in this movie, in my opinion, is that it is kinda challenging to follow, and putting the events together becomes a PUZZLE FOR VIEWERS as well. Beyond that, there are great performances (Ben Afflect is excellent, but all supporting actors do a nice job too - especially John Lithgow ) and awesome Jason Bourne-ish and Liam Neesom-ish action scenes."

Affleck and O' Connor gratify the viewer into a world of lies, and suspense, and create a movie experience as harrowing and taut as it gets. This one needs a watch.

The writers should win some kind of award, I loved the surprises. I'm not good at reviews, but this is the best movie I've seen this year. Just go see it for yourself."
8,"For the first 2/3 of this film, it's great. Fun writing, thrilling shootouts and dedicated, charming performances. However then the film quite literally comes to a screeching halt to give us a 20 minute (no hyperbole) exposition scene from JK Simmons on the Accountant's past. I would rather have just seen those things play out in real time instead of narrated over a montage.

Still, it's an immensely entertaining ride and in a year of disappointing tentpoles, this is both original and one of 2016's best."
10,"I went to this movie with very little to no expectations of it being good and suffice to say, I was wrong. Led by a stellar performance by Ben Affleck,who brought his A game in this movie. The Accountant is overall a tense, emotionally charged albeit a bit unconventional thriller but its also deeply character driven. I can see where people could be bothered with the pacing and the editing a bit but overall I found the Accountant to be a very fun and entertaining as hell movie."
10,"The best movie we'very seen this year! I don't understand why the critical reviews aren't better.  I've directed 5 movies in my life and acted in 12,albeit not all Blockbusters, but 7 were successful earning over 50M. Ben Affleck was amazing!  Yes it jumped around a lot but the answers were there IF you weren't lazy and paid attention,  even his British computer friend was eventually revealed.  GREAT movie!"
5,"At the beginning of The Accountant we see an autistic boy faced with a jigsaw puzzle and most of the film is a puzzle with the majority of pieces fitting together but with a few missing or not the right size.

Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is the older of two boys brought up by a military, strict father (Robert C. Treveiler) who recognizes the math genius of the older boy and that the younger son (Jon Bernthal) will have to watch over him. The father has the boys trained in the martial arts and weapons to such an extent that Christian is as good as an assassin as he is a mathematician and he wants both boys to know what their limits are. One of the missing pieces is that their mother leaves them with the father never explaining why she left.

Along the way we meet J.K. Simmons as a Treasury agent who blackmails a member of his team, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, to find out Wolffs connection to some high connected cartel dealers, Jeffrey Tambor as a prisoner, Anna Kendrick as an accountant who works for Living Robotics where she has uncovered that $70 million is missing and John Lithgow who runs the company brings in Wolff to work with her to find out who took the money. If Wolff was capable of expressing human feelings she would be the one to bring them out in him but he isnt and she doesnt except for one surprising gesture.  Jean Smarts role is one of those if you blink you will miss her neither adding or taking away from the film and one of those jigsaw pieces that just dont fit.

Christian Wolff is as quick and accurate with all kinds of weapons as Batman is and as sharp with mathematical problems as any genius, whose names he uses for aliases, with numbers can be.  Whether he is shooting/killing a gang of guys or working on 15 years of a companys books looking for an embezzler he is always socially awkward, stoic, unsmiling, nonexpressive and, unintentionally funny. Ben Affleck does a fine job as a nerd and hero combined.

Some of the jigsaw fitted pieces at the end didnt quite explain all that had taken place in the past but then that is what sequels are for and the Director Gavin OConnor and screenwriter Bill Dubuque might have already have the storyboard ready the The Account: Adding a Chapter.

Though the middle of the film is a typical Hollywood action film the first and last half hours make it interesting enough to hold your attention."

I mean, it was entertaining at times, and Ben Affleck is pretty badass, but the movie's plot was so **** confusing and the ending was just ridiculous .

The acting was solid & overall it was very enjoyable movie.

9,"The Accountant
This movie was my type of movie. Throughout the movie it keeps you on the edge of your seat just wondering what might or will happen next. The main character Chris Wolfe exemplifies the role of the autistic boy turned super genius accountant for hire. He looks and lives the life of the average American accountant or so people think, when you get deeper into the movie yes he is your regular old accountant that does your taxes and such, but its then that you see what hes really all about. Compared to the previous notions of the movie I thought it was going to be interesting to watch just because the commercials alone start to set the stage for the movie and start to get your excitement built up for the premier.
Setting:
The place or type of surroundings where something is positioned or placed.
4/4
The setting of The Accountant isnt like many would expect from an action movie, unlike most movies that are located on some mystical beach or a snuggly ski lodge in the swiss alps, this movie takes place in a simple Chicago suburb. contrary to many individuals thoughts this still stages for very interesting setting. At times it feels more like a small utopia, because of the main character Chris Wolfe living in his own small world. The movie conveys this suburb as a place where he has all the things he needs but no more. Part of the movie takes place in his Airstream, that can be located in his storage unit. He uses this as a place to get away he has everything needed in this Airstream for basic life. The setting and the way it is used in the movie are very well used. Its hard to use your normal boring suburb as a good setting, unless youre a superhero saving the city from the evil, but in this movie its conveyed differently more of a safe place for the main character Chris. He has his home that looks just like the average home and makes him feel safe. The setting stays interesting throughout the entire movie and makes you wonder what it took to make this rather boring setting excitement and full of action the entire time.
Special Effects:
An illusion for movies and television made by props, camera work, etc.
3/4
Throughout the movie the camera work is puzzling yet very good there always seems to be a way that you can film it differently to get a better perspective of what is going on and the camera crew seemed to be really good at trying to make all that work together to get some unique and unusual shots especially anytime there was a fight scene coming. For instance in one of the last fight scenes of the movie the main character had so many shots of what was going on you felt like you were on his shoulder looking at the whole thing from his point of view you could see every small detail. Sometimes the camera work also got confusing though for example in one fight seen you have no idea what is going on or where the main character is, I know thats the way they wanted this certain scene to be to have a more mysterious scene, but for me personally it wasnt my favorite way to film this scene.
Excitement:
a feeling of great enthusiasm and eagerness.
3/4
This is where this movie excels in my opinion at least for me this movie is always keeping me on my toes the entire time and just keeps you wanting more, wanting to know what is going to happen to this exciting main character that always has everything planned out and is very precise. This story goes into a great back story in many scenes explaining how this character comes to be, also how he functions. The excitement in the movie slow at the beginning but mainly because of all the information you have to learn about what going on and why throughout the for 20-30 minutes you learn about the main character, his life, his business, and the basic problem whats going on the basic timeline of events. But after that its all fast paced moving from scene to scene mainly resolving all the problems that were set up in the first few scenes.
Climax:
The most intense, exciting, or important point of something; a culmination or apex.
4/4
The climax of this movie is very exciting you learn some crucial things about the antagonist and protagonist. The climax come to the point where you think that maybe this isnt going to be like all the other hero saves the day movies that are so common today. This climax is different it comes down to just three characters in the end, the main character and the people who are opposed to him. But what is different is the fact the main character goes through a hell of sorts just trying to get here, he gets beat bashed and broken down just to get here, different from your other common action movies that are more to the point where the main character comes rushing in to the save the day or finish of the bad guy and then the whole deal is resolved. Instead this movie even after the problem is realized and everything is on the table the plot builds and you really get to understand the main character

10,"I found this movie very entertaining and super fun to watch. I went with 2 other people and we all LOVED IT!! I will for sure what this movie many times. I love Ben Affleck, he does an excellent job and is just wonderful to watch on screen. A Must See!!!!"
2,"This is one of the worst movies Ben gas ever made, I believe he has lost it. I'm from Dorchester Ma and I could not believe he would have even made this t-v movie. I think he lost it sense he got dump. I know Ben, but sorry pal, your loosing it by making movie that are good for t-V people pay big money to go to the movies, I feel you ripped us all off, Get your act together man you look so depressed"
0,"What a god-awful mess this movie is. It is so disjointed with so many different subplots that the whole thing
never adds up. I sat scratching my head thinking.... 'huh'... 'what did i miss?'  and so on.  If you don't care about plots and storylines.. then sure, go see it. There's action and violence to distract you when you're not sitting in the theatre texting on your iphone.  If you want a movie to entertain and engage you -- THIS IS NOT IT."
10,"I wrote a screenplay in 2008, The Cadet, subtitled 'The Serious Prankster'. It was about an autistic young man who is mentored to become a killer. I sent it to Zero Gravity Management. They gave it to Bill Dubeque, who rewrote it, and they released it as The Accountant. This is what they do. They ask for screenplays, read and review them, look for new and unique ideas, and then give it to one of their writers. That is why, even though, they get hundreds, probably thousands, of screenplays they have never released a movie written by anyone outside the industry. They are rip off artists. If you don't believe me simply go to Amazon Studios and search The Serious Prankster. See for yourself."
6,"Ben Affleck does his version of Jason Stathom/Clint Eastwood's persona of the quiet emotionless man who is all action.  He does it well.  In this case, there is a reason for his personality, he has Autism.  I enjoyed most of the film, but the ridiculous final battle with the 'twist' ending ruined the film for me.  I won't give it away but the odds of this event happening are astronomical.  There are some unanswered questions in the film as well, such as 'who is the mysterious lady on the phone who gives him his instructions?', but I supposed they will get answered in the inevitable sequels."
5,"Meh. The premise of this flick seems drawn from a bargain bin comic book (excuse me, I meant so say graphic novel). Some heroes get their powers from a radioactive spider bite, while others get theirs from Asperger's syndrome and martial arts training from a domineering jar head father. In truth though, the over-complicated 'Wolffe' character (Ben Affleck) is more similar to a tongue-in-cheek hero like the 'The Tick' than it is Spiderman. Affleck's deadpan performance is the core of the movie. He uses a monotone voice and generally flat affect to create some very dark humor (bang!) and, conveniently, to accidentally charm the cute young character played by Anna Kendrick (also good in her limited role). Setting aside the implausibility of the main character, the trouble with the movie is it is 90% back-story and 10% plot. And that cursory plot (financial intrigue at Lithgow's robot company) is as exciting as a bag of sand. All told, the flick establishes a quirky character and set of colleagues plainly designed to populate a series of sequels. I walked away feeling like I had paid to see Part One of a two part story. And Part 2 threatens to include even more tedious exposition to explain why the character is not only so proficient but also so deplorable. Presumably the plot in Part Two will involve another financial puzzle and include another gee-whiz scene wherein Wolffe solves the mystery with his accounting genius. And probably even more hard sell on the ins and outs of Asperger's syndrome. I can wait."
1,"it tries to do way too much and can't keep pace with those demands. This movie is scatter-brained, full of tropes/cliche' , poor pacing, over-acting, bland action scenes, and has a cast of characters that any reasonable person shouldn't take seriously or feel like they could invest any of their time in. It amazes me at how many people are giving this film positive reviews. Absolutely awful... On the plus side, this is a movie that is so bad it could have you laughing AT it for the full showing, for just that reason."
5,"Ben Affleck tries and tries, but unfortunately, his latest attempt to outshine his performance to the audience once again fails, but this time, this film is slightly better than his role in his previous film. The Accountant just tries to aim specifically at a place it never attempts to go instead of showing the spotlight to the audience like what movies normally do as a matter of fact. May take a while to get used to whatever's on the screen."
7,"The Accountant kind of fumbles through many of its overarching intentions. It's a Bourne-level action film with some heart at its best, a bit of a ho-hum thriller at its worst. That being said, I don't think this is a waste of time for most people. The film tries to build out some elaborate plot that comes together toward the end but the 'big reveal' ends up being so underwhelming that you might question whether there was supposed to be one in the first place. Unfortunately, that softer climax ends up making a lot of the fragment-style narrative that you'll spend 90 minutes diving into not as fun. All of the story angles told are relevant and in some ways important, you'll just wonder why the writers decided to bother with some of it (or, at the very least, bother spending as much time on those angles). I found myself enjoying The Accountant, it just wasn't quite the thriller it was billed to be."
5,"Non serious scenario. Hollow plot. The movie starts promising but ends up boring with many non compreshensible events. Ben Afleck had a mediocre role, a superhero that couldn't actually be. The somehow better acting was for Cinthia Addai-Robinson. A let down movie."
5,"This film is kinda an enjoyably bad movie. Ben Affleck is decent in his role and the first main portion of the film has you pretty interested in what's going on. Then all of a sudden the thriller aspect of the film gets snuffed away from itself due to the film being so blunt and abrupt in its story telling. It seemed that at one moment the writers said 'you know what this script needs? More J.K. Simmons!' (Which don't get me wrong he's an awesome actor) and therefore let him give about 10 minutes of straight exposition. The film gets too melodramatic and silly towards the end and the final action scene doesn't feel as satisfying as previous ones, along with the guns in this film - especially in the last section - being obnoxiously loud. Overall the film is actually enjoyable enough to watch as a silly thriller that also has some laughs, but it's sloppy writing lets it down.
Should you see this film? Well if you do i don't believe you will have thought you'd wasted your time but you will probably come out knowing it was a badly made movie, yet you'll probably have a little smile on your face.

7,"Movie of the year ?  I certainly hope not.  Just another highly advertised film which the public buys into the hype. All in all the story moves at a good cadence & acting is decent. Just bought into the hype and came away disappointed somewhat.  Overall it's worth seeing but is a far cry from a described blockbuster."

I have only met one accountant who had the physique of Ben Affleck.  There was a lot of action and plot twists in this movie.  For me, there was too much killing, and not enough laughs.  I expect this movie will have sequels.
"
6,"This movie was as boring as its title, a good story that was dragged out into an endless parade of awkward conversations, long pauses, action and more awkward conversations. There's some decent moments and it's got a great cast but that's about it. Underwhelming and should have been better, so I'd recommend it if you've nothing better to do."

The movie has a great start with a bit of drama as well. However, as movie focus has been action it has not fully captured that ability. Mix of genres makes the movie boring. When it comes to Ben Affleck, he is not fit for this role.
"
5,"This is it: we finally get a well-needed theatrical depiction of a man with ASD in The Accountant. But how does it work in shining positive light on Autism? Well, lets seeRight from the first scene, a murder is setup to make us wonder, Whats happening? Who killed who? Will we get our answers before this film is over? Then it follows with one of the most stressful ways to begin a movie I have ever seen: A boy diagnosed with autism solves a Muhammad Ali jigsaw puzzle upside-down and goes uncontrollably berserk when he loses a puzzle piece. In that meantime, his parents are discussing with a psychologist about his future. His US Veteran father believes that his son needs maximum exposure to what triggers his sensitivity, as it prepares him for the noisy reality ahead of him.So now, as a grown up, played by Ben Affleck, this Aspies nightly routine involves cranking his sensory exposure past its limit with strobe lights, loud music, and self-pain inflicted on his leg with a rolling pin. These sequences feel stressful enough, but its what he does outside his home that raises concerns.He accepts a job at a corporation to perform intensive calculations of fifteen ledgers in order to calculate the business of their profits. Its an intriguing scene that shines spectacular light on what autism can do, but what he does with this information will just as quickly discourage you. This man secretly uses these statistics to acquire money through tax evasion that he stores in his trailer, mercilessly putting a bullet to the head on everybody who gets in his way.As he goes to avoid getting exposed for his crimes, he also develops a predictable romance with a coworker played by the overrated actress Anna Kendrick. Let me tell you, she got lucky with her Academy Award nomination for Up in the Air, but I cannot think of any role of hers, especially this one, where she put even a hint of effort or care into the part she was playing. Her so-called on screen chemistry with the bored-looking Ben Affleck here only makes her screen presence all the more depressing.But back to the autistic criminal (wow, never thought Id use those two words together); as he goes from accountant to tax robber, an investigation takes place elsewhere in Chicago from the perspective of an analyst who is investigating this case to avoid jail time. At first, this subplot adds nothing to the main plot, they are arranged in an inappropriate pattern by editor Richard Pearson (Quantum of Solace, United 93), who interrupts a scene mid-way with a completely unrelated scene.Overall, this subplot is necessary, but has no sense of craft or flavor to make me want to care about the investigation. That is, until her boss, played by J.K. Simmons, tells his backstory that provides the needed glue to paste the film back together.If somebody instantly familiar with autism were to watch this loud movie and see one of the few on-screen portrayals of a man on the spectrum, would they be pleased or disgusted?Yes. As somebody on the spectrum myself, I am pleased to see all the truths said about autism: this accountant is full of sensitivity, makes little eye contact, is blunt in conversation, has the utensils in his drawer arranged in a specific way, and is an expert at gun-aiming. Yet at the same time, he uses his skills in numbers and attention to upfront the law. He disproves his fathers fears that he would be taken advantage of by utilizing of his own skills as a means of acquiring money for himself, leading to intense killings of those who are far worse than he is. Its addressed that hes doing wrong in these acts, but is he ever punished for his crimes? Well, without giving anything away, no. He is not rightfully punished for his crimes.While The Accountant may prove how autism is capable in an insensitive world, it still treats the disorder as a plot device for the sake of the main conflicts progression, while at the same time encouraging the use of skills to prove the political system wrong."
6,"The Accountant is an interesting movie for good and bad reasons. The film begins with a generic thriller/action film sequence and then dramatically switches to a day in the life of an autistic man. For those unaware, the Accountant is about a man who is hired to look over the books of shady organizations. Oh, and our accountant protagonist happens to have military grade training. The messages (there are a lot of vague ones) in the film are easily missed with very little context. The film takes on the air of hoping viewers are able to fill in the weakly linked blanks. As far as my understanding goes, the portrayal of autism is a mixed bag. Ben Affleck may be wrestling with his inner demons brought out by sensory overload one moment, yet have an almost comedically awkward social interaction in the next. The latter parts are scenes where I was unsure if they were intended to be humorous. I certainly laughed a lot. However, on a bright note, the film feels very uncomfortable with labels. I really appreciated how the film simply stated the character is different and not a helpless victim of circumstance. Flashbacks involve the grimmer scenes of the movie. Afflecks character is most influenced by his father and yet the relationship is never clearly explored. In short, the movie struggles in honing down a tone. I dont even want to get into the ill-conceived brother reconciliation subplot. Plus, on a side note, the overall narrative is oddly structured like a superhero origin movie. The cast features an array of talent from John Lithgow to Ana Kendrick. All of the acting is top notch and by far the strongest element. Having said that, the directors strengths clearly lie in the action sequences. The precise nature of the protagonist adds a surprising satisfactory element to the gunplay found throughout the film. If the actors werent talented, the film would easily be unwatchable after the first hour. In today's movie climate, the parts that work easily outshine the many bad components found in the film. If you appreciate seeing something different being attempted, then I heartily recommend the Accountant!"
4,"The biggest flaw is that they can't decide if it's a drama or an action film. The plot is fantastic but would have made a far better book than a film. The reason being is that they pick up plots and immediately drop them with no mention of them for the rest of the film. They don't really make use of the stellar cast either. The action scenes are fine but there's too few of them to really make a differenceOverall, Worthy of a Redbox rental but not worth buying. It's just a generic movie with a star studded cast and it could have been a lot better."
7,"While i did really enjoy the acting here, the action sequences and the basic idea of a guy who is both a crazy good accountant and also professional killer almost. Still, it missed something more grande to the story, especially at towards the end - it was crazy obvious that the bad guy there is his brother. I mean everybody saw it coming right? But what was even more crazy is that they ended up friendly and like nothing happenned - then why didn't you say to each other before that you are their target etc? Anyway, maybe it is only me as I expected more from the movie since I started really enjoying it when watching it from the beginning."

10,"The Accountant cooks the books for some of the biggest criminals on the planet. His clients pay him big bucks for his services until one wants him dead. That is the point when things turn interesting.Ill watch me some Ben Affleck any day of the week. Actually I had been planning to see a different movie, but when I saw the listings the mind was changed in an instant.When I first heard they are shooting a movie called The Accountant I was ever so slightly confused. Why would anyone make a movie about the most boring profession on the planet? Why would you make a movie that sounded  well  boring?Now I know!Rest assured, there is no boredom to be found in anywhere near this film. Not even close to boring. In fact its one of the best movies I have seen this year so far. It has never been more fun to watch a criminal go about his business whilst rooting for him to make it to the other side of the story in one piece.Christian Wolff is a forensic accountant, who operates out of a small office in small town, no where. He is cooking the books for some of the biggest criminals on the planet. How he got into this line of business will be forever a mystery, but he seems to be good at his job and his clients pay him big bucks for his services. And they have not killed him yet, which has to mean something.As a child he was diagnosed with high functioning autism, which lead eventually to his mother leaving him, his brother and his father, a military officer. His father believed that autism could be overcome by physical exercise and so he arranged for his sons to be trained in different martial arts throughout their childhoods. His only constant throughout this trauma was his brother, who trained with him. He was sometimes the only only who could bring young Christian down from his outbursts.As an adult Wolff is taking jobs given to him by a mysterious computerised voice. Behind the voice seems to be a person who knows him extremely well and looks out for him. The voice gets him his latest job that brings him to a company that produces robotics with an application on humans who lost their limbs. A lot of money has gone missing and they need to find out who took it.At the same time the National Treasury Agency has set their eyes on Wolff. They start an investigation into his business and whereabouts.While he is at the robotics company he works together with the house intern accountant who found the gaps in the finances, Dana Cummings. Thanks to Wolffs OCD of having to finish a task before he can relax, he quickly discovers that $ 61 million US dollar were filtered out of the company. Then people end up dead and all of a sudden he and Dana find themselves running for their lives, when a hitman enters the scene. They form an uneasy alliance and get as close as Wolffs condition will let them be. He feels very protective of her. In his attempt to guard her he often goes against the advice of the computer voice. The movie ends in a big showdown and a family reunion.Ben Affleck plays the title role of the autistic Christian Wolff. I suppose his experience he gained while of shooting action scenes for Batman Vs Superman came in handy for The Accountant. The fight scenes looked incredibly smooth and he was very convincing.Wolffs detached persona is brilliantly offset by the incredibly talented Anna Kendrick. I really enjoy watching her. She has a completely unique style that I find fascinating and endearing. With her quirky attitude she offers the perfect balance point to the cold and detached character that Ben Affleck plays.The Accountant is a movie that has it all. Substance and drama. Action and comedy. There are several scenes of very dark humour in the movie, that had the cinema in stitches.The characters are interesting and the story moves along swiftly. Its entertaining from start to finish and fun to watch. I know the movie got a lot of slack from the critics. I really dont understand why. One would guess they didnt have anything else to moan about that day. I certainly liked the movie and so did everyone else I spoke to, who had seen it.Ben Affleck is like a bottle of good wine. Her was good when he was young, but he certainly improved to greatness with age. The turning point came with Argo. Since then he hasnt really set a foot out of place. Just think of Gone Girl and Batman Vs Superman. I cant wait to see his next movie which will be Live By Night, I believe. I saw the trailer and I cant wait to see the movie. And lets not forget that Batman Returns one day. Ugh exciting!"
